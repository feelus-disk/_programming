<p>Schedule a command or batch file to run on a computer at a specific date 
and time. Additional scheduling options are available with the <a href="schtasks.html">SCHTASKS</a> command. The AT command has been deprecated and is no longer available In Windows 8.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      Create an AT job:
      AT [\\computername] hh:mm [/INTERACTIVE] [ /EVERY:day(s) | /NEXT:day(s) ] "command"

      Delete an AT job:
      AT [\\computername] [ [id] [/DELETE] | /DELETE [/YES]] 

Key<br>   \\computername : Execute the AT command on a remote computer. 

   id             : An id number AT assigns to each scheduled job.

   /delete        : Cancel a scheduled job. If id is omitted, all jobs are deleted.

   /yes           : Use with /delete to supress the confirmation message.

   hh:mm          : The time to run the command.

   /interactive   : Allow the job to interact with the desktop of 
                    the current user when the job runs.

   /every:day(s)  : Run the command every day(s) of the week or month. 
                    (default: dd=today) 

   /next:day(s)   : Run the command on the next occurrence of the day. 
                    (default: dd=today)

   "command"      : The batch program or command to run. If the path 
                    to this includes spaces, put double quotation marks  
                    around the path. "C:\Program Files\My Batch.cmd"</pre>
<p> Day(s) are in this format: (English Locale EN)<br>
<br>
Monday = <span class="code">m</span><br>
Tuesday =<span class="code"> t</span><br>
Wednesday =<span class="code"> w</span><br>
Thursday =<span class="code"> th</span><br>
Friday =<span class="code"> f</span><br>
Saturday =<span class="code"> s</span><br>
Sunday =<span class="code"> su</span><br>
<br>
or a specific day of the month: <br>
e.g. 5th of every month =<span class="code"> 5</span></p>
<p>In other locales the day(s) may be different letters:<br>
Italian:  <span class="code">L,MA,ME,g,v,s,d</span><br>
German: <span class="code">M, T, W, Th, F, S, Su</span><br>
French: <span class="code">L, Ma, Me, J, V, S, D</span><br>
</p>
<h2>AT vs 'Scheduled Tasks'</h2>
<p>The &quot;Task Scheduler&quot; service must be running to use the AT command.
The &quot;Schedule&quot; service (ATSVC) rather than the &quot;Task Scheduler&quot; service must be running to use <a href="http://ss64.com/nt/zsoon.html">SOON</a> with a delay of less than 60 seconds. - 
see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=237840">Q237840</a>  </p>
<p>You can use the Scheduled Tasks folder to view or modify the settings of a task that was created by using the AT command. When you schedule a task using
the <span class="code">at</span> command, the task is listed in the Scheduled Tasks folder, with a name such as:At3478. However, if you modify an AT task through the
Scheduled Tasks folder, it is upgraded to a normal scheduled task. The task is no longer visible to the at command, and the at account setting no longer
applies to it. You must explicitly enter a user account and password for the task. For most purposes the <a href="schtasks.html">SchTasks</a> command is a better choice than AT.</p>
<h2>Commands to Process</h2>
<p>At does not automatically load <a href="cmd.html">Cmd</a>.exe,
the command interpreter. If you are not running an executable (.exe) file,
you must explicitly load CMD at the beginning of the command e.g. <span class="code">cmd /c
dir<br>
</span>Don&rsquo;t try to pass more than one command into AT, put multiple commands into a batch file and then  call the batch file from
AT.</p>
<h2>Permissions required to issue an AT command</h2>
<p> By default only a <span class="code">Local Administrator</span> can issue an AT command, a <span class="code">Domain Admin</span> can direct an AT command at any machine. AT will run commands under the local SYSTEM account, under Windows XP this can be used as a source of privilege escalation.</p>
<h2>Permissions required by the service account</h2><p>  The User Account under which the Schedule service runs may require specific file access permissions, user permissions and drive mappings.<br>
 The User Account is selected under MyComputer, ScheduledTasks, Advanced (Menu), AT Service Account. You also need to stop and restart the service before the change in UserAccount will take effect.<br>
<br>Here's how to check if a user account has sufficent rights for a particular task: <br>
<br>
<span class="code">C:\&gt; AT 14:32 /interactive %comspec% /k </span><br>
<br>Setting hh:mm for one minute from now will open a cmd window at the specified time. In this window you can check the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="body">The <a href="path.html">PATH</a></span></li>
<li><span class="body"><a href="set.html">Environment</a> variables (particularly TEMP).</span></li>
<li><span class="body">Drive mappings - you can add these by putting appropriate <a href="net.html">NET</a> USE... commands at the beginning of your batch 
file.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> Next, go ahead and run your batch file in this console window, note the errors, and fix them. Once the errors have been fixed, you can remove the /interactive switch and schedule the batch file with some confidence that 
it will work as intended.</p>
<h2>  Bugs</h2>
<p>  If you change the system time after scheduling a command with AT, synchronize the  scheduler with the revised system time by typing AT without any command-line options.</p>
<p>By default, AT jobs will stop running after 72 hours. <br>
You can modify this in the registry.</p>
<p> <span class="code">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Schedule</span><br>
 Value:<br>
<span class="code">AtTaskMaxHours</span>  Data type: REG_DWORD <br>
Decimal Value Data: 0. <br>
A value of 0  indicates no limit, does not stop.
<br>
Values from 1 through 99 indicate the number of hours.</p>
<p>Other Task Scheduler options are stored in the registry</p>
<pre>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SchedulingAgent\
</pre>
<p><b>Examples:</b><br>
  <br>
Run a command every day<br>
<br>
<span class="code">AT 23:30 /EVERY:m,t,w,th,f,s,su c:\backups\every_day.cmd</span><br>
<br>
Run a command every Friday<br>
<br>
<span class="code">AT 23:30 /EVERY:f c:\backups\weekly.cmd</span><br>
<br>
Remove all scheduled AT jobs <br>
<br>
<span class="code">AT /delete /yes</span><br>
<br>
Run a command this evening (once only)<br>
<br>
<span class="code">AT 23:30 /NEXT: c:\backups\today.cmd</span></p>
