<p>When working with Event IDs it can be important to specify the <i>source</i> in addition to the <i>ID</i>, the same number can have different meanings in different logs from different sources.</p>
<p>With the launch of Vista many security event IDs changed, for most  security events: VistaEventId = <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericfitz/archive/2007/04/18/vista-security-events-get-noticed.aspx">PreVistaEventId + 4096</a><br>
The relationship between old and new IDs is not entirely 1:1 (you will notice some duplicate numbers in the table above.)</p>
<p>It is possible to view event logs from a remote computer, but if the remote machine is vista or later and the local machine is XP or 2003 then you will see the following error: &quot;The local computer may not have the necessary registry information or message DLL files to display messages from a remote computer.&quot;</p>
