<h4 class="subsection">10.4.1 Prerequisite Macros</h4>

<p><a name="index-Prerequisite-macros-1658"></a><a name="index-Macros_002c-prerequisites-1659"></a>
A macro that you write might need to use values that have previously
been computed by other macros.  For example, <code>AC_DECL_YYTEXT</code>
examines the output of <code>flex</code> or <code>lex</code>, so it depends on
<code>AC_PROG_LEX</code> having been called first to set the shell variable
<code>LEX</code>.

   <p>Rather than forcing the user of the macros to keep track of the
dependencies between them, you can use the <code>AC_REQUIRE</code> macro to do
it automatically.  <code>AC_REQUIRE</code> can ensure that a macro is only
called if it is needed, and only called once.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>AC_REQUIRE</b> (<var>macro-name</var>)<var><a name="index-AC_005fREQUIRE-1660"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-AC_005fREQUIRE-1661"></a>
If the M4 macro <var>macro-name</var> has not already been called, call it
(without any arguments).  Make sure to quote <var>macro-name</var> with
square brackets.  <var>macro-name</var> must have been defined using
<code>AC_DEFUN</code> or else contain a call to <code>AC_PROVIDE</code> to indicate
that it has been called.

        <p><code>AC_REQUIRE</code> must be used inside a macro defined by <code>AC_DEFUN</code>; it
must not be called from the top level.  Also, it does not make sense to
require a macro that takes parameters. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><code>AC_REQUIRE</code> is often misunderstood.  It really implements
dependencies between macros in the sense that if one macro depends upon
another, the latter is expanded <em>before</em> the body of the
former.  To be more precise, the required macro is expanded before
the outermost defined macro in the current expansion stack. 
In particular, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">AC_REQUIRE([FOO])</span></samp>&rsquo; is not replaced with the body of
<code>FOO</code>.  For instance, this definition of macros:

<pre class="example">     AC_DEFUN([TRAVOLTA],
     [test "$body_temperature_in_celsius" -gt "38" &amp;&amp;
       dance_floor=occupied])
     AC_DEFUN([NEWTON_JOHN],
     [test "x$hair_style" = xcurly &amp;&amp;
       dance_floor=occupied])
     
     AC_DEFUN([RESERVE_DANCE_FLOOR],
     [if date | grep '^Sat.*pm' &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then
       AC_REQUIRE([TRAVOLTA])
       AC_REQUIRE([NEWTON_JOHN])
     fi])
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">with this <samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp>

<pre class="example">     AC_INIT([Dance Manager], [1.0], [bug-dance@example.org])
     RESERVE_DANCE_FLOOR
     if test "x$dance_floor" = xoccupied; then
       AC_MSG_ERROR([cannot pick up here, let's move])
     fi
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">does not leave you with a better chance to meet a kindred soul at
other times than Saturday night since it expands into:

<pre class="example">     test "$body_temperature_in_Celsius" -gt "38" &amp;&amp;
       dance_floor=occupied
     test "x$hair_style" = xcurly &amp;&amp;
       dance_floor=occupied
     fi
     if date | grep '^Sat.*pm' &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then
     
     
     fi
</pre>
   <p>This behavior was chosen on purpose: (i) it prevents messages in
required macros from interrupting the messages in the requiring macros;
(ii) it avoids bad surprises when shell conditionals are used, as in:

<pre class="example">     if ...; then
       AC_REQUIRE([SOME_CHECK])
     fi
     ...
     SOME_CHECK
</pre>
   <p>However, this implementation can lead to another class of problems. 
Consider the case where an outer macro first expands, then indirectly
requires, an inner macro:

<pre class="example">     AC_DEFUN([TESTA], [[echo in A
     if test -n "$SEEN_A" ; then echo duplicate ; fi
     SEEN_A=:]])
     AC_DEFUN([TESTB], [AC_REQUIRE([TESTA])[echo in B
     if test -z "$SEEN_A" ; then echo bug ; fi]])
     AC_DEFUN([TESTC], [AC_REQUIRE([TESTB])[echo in C]])
     AC_DEFUN([OUTER], [[echo in OUTER]
     TESTA
     TESTC])
     OUTER
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Prior to Autoconf 2.64, the implementation of <code>AC_REQUIRE</code>
recognized that <code>TESTB</code> needed to be hoisted prior to the expansion
of <code>OUTER</code>, but because <code>TESTA</code> had already been directly
expanded, it failed to hoist <code>TESTA</code>.  Therefore, the expansion of
<code>TESTB</code> occurs prior to its prerequisites, leading to the following
output:

<pre class="example">     in B
     bug
     in OUTER
     in A
     in C
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Newer Autoconf is smart enough to recognize this situation, and hoists
<code>TESTA</code> even though it has already been expanded, but issues a
syntax warning in the process.  This is because the hoisted expansion of
<code>TESTA</code> defeats the purpose of using <code>AC_REQUIRE</code> to avoid
redundant code, and causes its own set of problems if the hoisted macro
is not idempotent:

<pre class="example">     in A
     in B
     in OUTER
     in A
     duplicate
     in C
</pre>
   <p>The bug is not in Autoconf, but in the macro definitions.  If you ever
pass a particular macro name to <code>AC_REQUIRE</code>, then you are implying
that the macro only needs to be expanded once.  But to enforce this,
either the macro must be declared with <code>AC_DEFUN_ONCE</code> (although
this only helps in Autoconf 2.64 or newer), or all
uses of that macro should be through <code>AC_REQUIRE</code>; directly
expanding the macro defeats the point of using <code>AC_REQUIRE</code> to
eliminate redundant expansion.  In the example, this rule of thumb was
violated because <code>TESTB</code> requires <code>TESTA</code> while <code>OUTER</code>
directly expands it.  One way of fixing the bug is to factor
<code>TESTA</code> into two macros, the portion designed for direct and
repeated use (here, named <code>TESTA</code>), and the portion designed for
one-shot output and used only inside <code>AC_REQUIRE</code> (here, named
<code>TESTA_PREREQ</code>).  Then, by fixing all clients to use the correct
calling convention according to their needs:

<pre class="example">     AC_DEFUN([TESTA], [AC_REQUIRE([TESTA_PREREQ])[echo in A]])
     AC_DEFUN([TESTA_PREREQ], [[echo in A_PREREQ
     if test -n "$SEEN_A" ; then echo duplicate ; fi
     SEEN_A=:]])
     AC_DEFUN([TESTB], [AC_REQUIRE([TESTA_PREREQ])[echo in B
     if test -z "$SEEN_A" ; then echo bug ; fi]])
     AC_DEFUN([TESTC], [AC_REQUIRE([TESTB])[echo in C]])
     AC_DEFUN([OUTER], [[echo in OUTER]
     TESTA
     TESTC])
     OUTER
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the resulting output will then obey all dependency rules and avoid any
syntax warnings, whether the script is built with old or new Autoconf
versions:

<pre class="example">     in A_PREREQ
     in B
     in OUTER
     in A
     in C
</pre>
   <p>The helper macros <code>AS_IF</code> and <code>AS_CASE</code> may be used to
enforce expansion of required macros outside of shell conditional
constructs.  You are furthermore encouraged, although not required, to
put all <code>AC_REQUIRE</code> calls
at the beginning of a macro.  You can use <code>dnl</code> to avoid the empty
lines they leave.
