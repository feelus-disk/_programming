<p><b>Bourne Shell Variables</b></p>
<p>Bash uses certain shell variables in the same way as the Bourne shell. In some 
  cases, Bash assigns a default value to the variable. Bash automatically assigns 
  default values to a number of variables.</p>
<dl compact> 
  <dt><code>CDPATH</code> 
  <dd>A colon-separated list of directories used as a search path for the <code>cd</code> 
    builtin command. 
  <dt><code>HOME</code> 
  <dd>The current user's home directory; the default for the <code>cd</code> builtin 
    command. The value of this variable is also used by tilde expansion. 
  <dt><code>IFS</code> 
  <dd>A list of characters that separate fields; used when the shell splits words 
    as part of expansion. 
  <dt><code>MAIL</code> 
  <dd>If this parameter is set to a filename and the <code>MAILPATH</code> variable 
    is not set, Bash informs the user of the arrival of mail in the specified 
    file. 
  <dt><code>MAILPATH</code> 
  <dd>A colon-separated list of filenames which the shell periodically checks 
    for new mail. Each list entry can specify the message that is printed when 
    new mail arrives in the mail file by separating the file name from the message 
    with a <samp>`?'</samp>. When used in the text of the message, <code>$_</code> 
    expands to the name of the current mail file. 
  <dt><code>OPTARG</code> 
  <dd>The value of the last option argument processed by the <code>getopts</code> 
    builtin. 
  <dt><code>OPTIND</code> 
  <dd>The index of the last option argument processed by the <code>getopts</code> 
    builtin. 
  <dt><code>PATH</code> 
  <dd>A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands. 
  <dt><code>PS1</code> 
  <dd>The primary prompt string. The default value is <samp>`\s-\v\$ '</samp>.
  <dt><code>PS2</code> 
  <dd>The secondary prompt string. The default value is <samp>`&gt; '</samp>. 
  </dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Bash Variables</b></p>
<p>These variables are set or used by Bash, but other shells do not normally treat 
  them specially. </p>
<p>A few variables used by Bash are described in different chapters: variables 
  for controlling the job control facilities. </p>
<dl compact> 
  <dt><code>BASH</code> 
  <dd>The full pathname used to execute the current instance of Bash. 
  <dt><code>BASH_ENV</code> 
  <dd>If this variable is set when Bash is invoked to execute a shell script, 
    its value is expanded and used as the name of a startup file to read before 
    executing the script. 
  <dt><code>BASH_VERSION</code> 
  <dd>The version number of the current instance of Bash. 
  <dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO</code> 
  <dd>A readonly array variable whose members hold version information for this 
    instance of Bash. The values assigned to the array members are as follows: 
    <dl compact> 
      <dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[0]</code> 
      <dd>The major version number (the <var>release</var>). 
      <dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[1]</code> 
      <dd>The minor version number (the <var>version</var>). 
      <dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[2]</code> 
      <dd>The patch level. 
      <dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[3]</code> 
      <dd>The build version. 
      <dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[4]</code> 
      <dd>The release status (e.g., <var>beta1</var>). 
      <dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[5]</code> 
      <dd>The value of <code>MACHTYPE</code>. </dd>
    </dl>
  <dt><code>COMP_WORDS</code> 
  <dd>An array variable consisting of the individual words in the current command 
    line. This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the programmable 
    completion facilities. 
  <dt><code>COMP_CWORD</code> 
  <dd>An index into <code>${COMP_WORDS}</code> of the word containing the current 
    cursor position. This variable is available only in shell functions invoked 
    by the programmable completion facilities. 
  <dt><code>COMP_LINE</code> 
  <dd>The current command line. This variable is available only in shell functions 
    and external commands invoked by the programmable completion facilities. 
  <dt><code>COMP_POINT</code> 
  <dd>The index of the current cursor position relative to the beginning of the 
    current command. If the current cursor position is at the end of the current 
    command, the value of this variable is equal to <code>${#COMP_LINE}</code>. 
    This variable is available only in shell functions and external commands invoked 
    by the programmable completion facilities. 
  <dt><code>COMPREPLY</code> 
  <dd>An array variable from which Bash reads the possible completions generated 
    by a shell function invoked by the programmable completion facility. 
  <dt><code>DIRSTACK</code> 
  <dd>An array variable containing the current contents of the directory stack. 
    Directories appear in the stack in the order they are displayed by the <code>dirs</code> 
    builtin. Assigning to members of this array variable may be used to modify directories already in the stack, but the <code>pushd</code> and <code>popd</code> 
    builtins must be used to add and remove directories. Assignment to this variable 
    will not change the current directory. If <code>DIRSTACK</code> is unset, 
    it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. 
  <dt><code>EUID</code> 
  <dd>The numeric effective user id of the current user. This variable is readonly. 
  <dt><code>FCEDIT</code> 
  <dd>The editor used as a default by the <samp>`-e'</samp> option to the <code>fc</code> 
    builtin command. 
  <dt><code>FIGNORE</code> 
  <dd>A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing filename completion. 
    A file name whose suffix matches one of the entries in <code>FIGNORE</code> 
    is excluded from the list of matched file names. A sample value is <samp>`.o:~'</samp> 
  <dt><code>GLOBIGNORE</code> 
  <dd>A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of filenames to be ignored by filename expansion. If a filename matched by a filename expansion pattern also matches one of the patterns in <code>GLOBIGNORE</code>, it is removed 
    from the list of matches. 
  <dt><code>GROUPS</code> 
  <dd>An array variable containing the list of groups of which the current user is a member. Assignments to <code>GROUPS</code> have no effect and are silently discarded. If <code>GROUPS</code> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. 
<dt><code>histchars</code> 
  <dd>Up to three characters which control history expansion, quick substitution, and tokenization. The first character is the <var>history expansion</var> character, that is, the character which signifies the start of a history expansion, 
    normally <samp>`!'</samp>. The second character is the character which signifies `quick substitution' when seen as the first character on a line, normally <samp>`^'</samp>. The optional third character is the character which indicates that the remainder of the line is a comment when found as the first character of a word, usually <samp>`#'</samp>. The history comment character causes history substitution to be skipped for the remaining words on the line. It does not necessarily cause the shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment. 
<dt><code>HISTCMD</code> 
  <dd>The history number, or index in the history list, of the current command. If <code>HISTCMD</code> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. 
<dt><code>FUNCNAME</code> 
  <dd>The name of any currently-executing shell function. This variable exists only when a shell function is executing. Assignments to <code>FUNCNAME</code> 
    have no effect and are silently discarded. If <code>FUNCNAME</code> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. 
<dt><code>HISTCONTROL</code> 
  <dd>A value of <samp>`ignorespace'</samp> means to not enter lines which begin with a space or tab into the history list. A value of <samp>`ignoredups'</samp> 
    means to not enter lines which match the last entered line. A value of <samp>`ignoreboth'</samp> 
    combines the two options. Unset, or set to any other value than those above, means to save all lines on the history list. The second and subsequent lines 
    of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of <code>HISTCONTROL</code>. 
  <dt><code>HISTIGNORE</code> 
  <dd>A colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which command lines should be saved on the history list. Each pattern is anchored at the beginning of 
    the line and must match the complete line (no implicit <samp>`*'</samp> is appended). Each pattern is tested against the line after the checks specified by <code>HISTCONTROL</code> are applied. In addition to the normal shell pattern matching characters, <samp>`&amp;'</samp> matches the previous history line. 
    <samp>`&amp;'</samp> may be escaped using a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match. The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of <code>HISTIGNORE</code>. <code>HISTIGNORE</code> subsumes the function of <code>HISTCONTROL</code>. A pattern of <samp>`&amp;'</samp> is 
    identical to <code>ignoredups</code>, and a pattern of <samp>`[ ]*'</samp> 
    is identical to <code>ignorespace</code>. Combining these two patterns, separating them with a colon, provides the functionality of <code>ignoreboth</code>. 
  <dt><code>HISTFILE</code> 
  <dd>The name of the file to which the command history is saved. The default value is<span class="code"> ~/.bash_history</span><dt><code>HISTSIZE</code> 
  <dd>The maximum number of commands to remember on the history list. The default value is 500. 
<dt><code>HISTFILESIZE</code> 
  <dd>The maximum number of lines contained in the history file. When this variable is assigned a value, the history file is truncated, if necessary, to contain 
    no more than that number of lines. The history file is also truncated to this size after writing it when an interactive shell exits. The default value is 
    500. 
<dt><code>HOSTFILE</code> 
  <dd>Contains the name of a file in the same format as<span class="code"> /etc/hosts </span>that should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname. The list of possible hostname completions may be changed while the shell is running; 
    the next time hostname completion is attempted after the value is changed, 
    Bash adds the contents of the new file to the existing list. If <code>HOSTFILE</code> 
    is set, but has no value, Bash attempts to read<span class="code"> /etc/hosts</span> to obtain 
    the list of possible hostname completions. When <code>HOSTFILE</code> is unset, 
    the hostname list is cleared. 
<dt><code>HOSTNAME</code> 
  <dd>The name of the current host. 
  <dt><code>HOSTTYPE</code> 
  <dd>A string describing the machine Bash is running on. 
  <dt><code>IGNOREEOF</code> 
  <dd>Controls the action of the shell on receipt of an <code>EOF</code> character 
    as the sole input. If set, the value denotes the number of consecutive <code>EOF</code> 
    characters that can be read as the first character on an input line before 
    the shell will exit. If the variable exists but does not have a numeric value 
    (or has no value) then the default is 10. If the variable does not exist, 
    then <code>EOF</code> signifies the end of input to the shell. This is only 
    in effect for interactive shells. 
  <dt><code>INPUTRC</code> 
  <dd>The name of the Readline initialization file, overriding the default of<span class="code"> ~/.inputrc</span>. 
<dt><code>LANG</code> 
  <dd>Used to determine the locale category for any category not specifically 
    selected with a variable starting with <code>LC_</code>. 
  <dt><code>LC_ALL</code> 
  <dd>This variable overrides the value of <code>LANG</code> and any other <code>LC_</code> 
    variable specifying a locale category. 
  <dt><code>LC_COLLATE</code> 
  <dd>This variable determines the collation order used when sorting the results 
    of filename expansion, and determines the behavior of range expressions, equivalence 
    classes, and collating sequences within filename expansion and pattern matching. 
  <dt><code>LC_CTYPE</code> 
  <dd>This variable determines the interpretation of characters and the behavior 
    of character classes within filename expansion and pattern matching. 
  <dt><code>LC_MESSAGES</code> 
  <dd>This variable determines the locale used to translate double-quoted strings 
    preceded by a <samp>`$'</samp>. 
  <dt><code>LC_NUMERIC</code> 
  <dd>This variable determines the locale category used for number formatting. 
  <dt><code>LINENO</code> 
  <dd>The line number in the script or shell function currently executing. 
  <dt><code>MACHTYPE</code> 
  <dd>A string that fully describes the system type on which Bash is executing, 
    in the standard GNU <var>cpu-company-system</var> format. 
  <dt><code>MAILCHECK</code> 
  <dd>How often (in seconds) that the shell should check for mail in the files 
    specified in the <code>MAILPATH</code> or <code>MAIL</code> variables. 
  <dt><code>OLDPWD</code> 
  <dd>The previous working directory as set by the <code>cd</code> builtin. 
  <dt><code>OPTERR</code> 
  <dd>If set to the value 1, Bash displays error messages generated by the <code>getopts</code> 
    builtin command. 
  <dt><code>OSTYPE</code> 
  <dd>A string describing the operating system Bash is running on. 
  <dt><code>PIPESTATUS</code> 
  <dd>An array variable containing a list of exit status values from the processes 
    in the most-recently-executed foreground pipeline (which may contain only 
    a single command). 
  <dt><code>PPID</code> 
  <dd>The process ID of the shell's parent process. This variable is readonly. 
  <dt><code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> 
  <dd>If set, the value is interpreted as a command to execute before the printing 
    of each primary prompt (<code>$PS1</code>). 
  <dt><code>PS3</code> 
  <dd>The value of this variable is used as the prompt for the <code>select</code> 
    command. If this variable is not set, the <code>select</code> command prompts 
    with <samp>`#? '</samp> 
  <dt><code>PS4</code> 
  <dd>The value is the prompt printed before the command line is echoed when the 
    <samp>`-x'</samp> option is set. The first character of <code>PS4</code> is 
    replicated multiple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple levels of indirection. 
    The default is <samp>`+ '</samp>. 
  <dt><code>PWD</code> 
  <dd>The current working directory as set by the <code>cd</code> builtin. 
  <dt><code>RANDOM</code> 
  <dd>Each time this parameter is referenced, a random integer between 0 and 32767 
    is generated. Assigning a value to this variable seeds the random number generator. 
  <dt><code>REPLY</code> 
  <dd>The default variable for the <code>read</code> builtin. 
  <dt><code>SECONDS</code> 
  <dd>This variable expands to the number of seconds since the shell was started. 
    Assignment to this variable resets the count to the value assigned, and the 
    expanded value becomes the value assigned plus the number of seconds since 
    the assignment. 
  <dt><code>SHELLOPTS</code> 
  <dd>A colon-separated list of enabled shell options. Each word in the list is 
    a valid argument for the <samp>`-o'</samp> option to the <code>set</code> 
    builtin command. The options appearing in <code>SHELLOPTS</code> are those 
    reported as <samp>`on'</samp> by <samp>`set -o'</samp>. If this variable is 
    in the environment when Bash starts up, each shell option in the list will 
    be enabled before reading any startup files. This variable is readonly. 
  <dt><code>SHLVL</code> 
  <dd>Incremented by one each time a new instance of Bash is started. This is 
    intended to be a count of how deeply your Bash shells are nested. 
  <dt><code>TIMEFORMAT</code> 
  <dd>The value of this parameter is used as a format string specifying how the 
    timing information for pipelines prefixed with the <code>time</code> reserved 
    word should be displayed. The <samp>`%'</samp> character introduces an escape 
    sequence that is expanded to a time value or other information. The escape 
    sequences and their meanings are as follows; the braces denote optional portions. 
    <dl compact> 
      <dt><code>%%</code> 
      <dd>A literal <samp>`%'</samp>. 
      <dt><code>%[<var>p</var>][l]R</code> 
      <dd>The elapsed time in seconds. 
      <dt><code>%[<var>p</var>][l]U</code> 
      <dd>The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode. 
      <dt><code>%[<var>p</var>][l]S</code> 
      <dd>The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode. 
      <dt><code>%P</code> 
      <dd>The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R. </dd>
    </dl>
    The optional <var>p</var> is a digit specifying the precision, the number 
    of fractional digits after a decimal point. A value of 0 causes no decimal 
    point or fraction to be output. At most three places after the decimal point 
    may be specified; values of <var>p</var> greater than 3 are changed to 3. 
    If <var>p</var> is not specified, the value 3 is used. The optional <code>l</code> 
    specifies a longer format, including minutes, of the form <var>MM</var>m<var>SS</var>.<var>FF</var>s. 
    The value of <var>p</var> determines whether or not the fraction is included. 
    If this variable is not set, Bash acts as if it had the value 
  <pre><code>$'\nreal\t%3lR\nuser\t%3lU\nsys\t%3lS'</code>
</pre>
<dd>
<p> If the value is null, no timing information is displayed. A trailing newline is added when the format string is displayed. 
</p>
<dt><code>TMOUT</code> 
<dd>If set to a value greater than zero, the value is interpreted as the number of seconds to wait for input after issuing the primary prompt when the shell is interactive. Bash terminates after that number of seconds if input does not arrive. 
<dt><code>UID</code> 
  <dd>The numeric real user id of the current user. This variable is readonly.</dd>
