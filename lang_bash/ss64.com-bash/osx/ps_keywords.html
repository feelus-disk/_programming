<p>Keywords for the <a href="ps.html">ps command</a>. <br>
  Multiple keywords may be space or comma separated.<br>
</p>
<pre>     %cpu    The cpu utilization of the process; this is a decaying average
	     over up to a minute of previous (real) time.  Since the time base
	     over which this is computed varies (since processes may be very
	     young) it is possible for the sum of all %CPU fields to exceed 100%.

     %mem    The percentage of real memory used by this process.

     flags   The flags associated with the process as in the include file
	     :

	     P_ADVLOCK	    0x00001	   Process may hold a POSIX advisory
					   lock
	     P_CONTROLT	    0x00002	   Has a controlling terminal
	     P_INMEM	    0x00004	   Loaded into memory
	     P_NOCLDSTOP    0x00008	   No SIGCHLD when children stop
	     P_PPWAIT	    0x00010	   Parent is waiting for child to
					   exec/exit
	     P_PROFIL	    0x00020	   Has started profiling
	     P_SELECT	    0x00040	   Selecting; wakeup/waiting danger
	     P_SINTR	    0x00080	   Sleep is interruptible
	     P_SUGID	    0x00100	   Had set id privileges since last
					   exec
	     P_SYSTEM	    0x00200	   System proc: no sigs, stats or
					   swapping
	     P_TIMEOUT	    0x00400	   Timing out during sleep
	     P_TRACED	    0x00800	   Debugged process being traced
	     P_WAITED	    0x01000	   Debugging process has waited for
					   child
	     P_WEXIT	    0x02000	   Working on exiting
	     P_EXEC	    0x04000	   Process called exec
	     P_NOSWAP	    0x08000	   Another flag to prevent swap out
	     P_PHYSIO	    0x10000	   Doing physical I/O
	     P_OWEUPC	    0x20000	   Owe process an addupc() call at
					   next ast
	     P_SWAPPING	    0x40000	   Process is being swapped

     lim     The soft limit on memory used, specified via a call to
	     setrlimit(2).

     lstart  The exact time the command started, using the ``%c'' format
	     described in strftime(3).

     nice    The process scheduling increment (see setpriority(2)).

     rss     the real memory (resident set) size of the process (in 1024 byte
	     units).

     start   The time the command started.  If the command started less than
	     24 hours ago, the start time is displayed using the ``%l:ps.1p''
	     format described in strftime(3).  If the command started less
	     than 7 days ago, the start time is displayed using the
	     ``%a6.15p'' format.  Otherwise, the start time is displayed using
	     the ``%e%b%y'' format.

     state   The state is given by a sequence of letters, for example,
	     ``RWNA''.	The first letter indicates the run state of the pro-
	     cess:

	     D	     Marks a process in disk (or other short term, uninter-
		     ruptible) wait.
	     I	     Marks a process that is idle (sleeping for longer than
		     about 20 seconds).
	     R	     Marks a runnable process.
	     S	     Marks a process that is sleeping for less than about 20
		     seconds.
	     T	     Marks a stopped process.
	     Z	     Marks a dead process (a ``zombie'').

	     Additional characters after these, if any, indicate additional
	     state information:

	     +	     The process is in the foreground process group of its
		     control terminal.
	     <	     The process has raised CPU scheduling priority.
	     >	     The process has specified a soft limit on memory require-
		     ments and is currently exceeding that limit; such a pro-
		     cess is (necessarily) not swapped.
	     A	     the process has asked for random page replacement
		     (VA_ANOM, from vadvise(2), for example, lisp(1) in a
		     garbage collect).
	     E	     The process is trying to exit.
	     L	     The process has pages locked in core (for example, for
		     raw I/O).
	     N	     The process has reduced CPU scheduling priority (see
		     setpriority(2)).
	     S	     The process has asked for FIFO page replacement (VA_SEQL,
		     from vadvise(2), for example, a large image processing
		     program using virtual memory to sequentially address
		     voluminous data).
	     s	     The process is a session leader.
	     V	     The process is suspended during a vfork.
	     W	     The process is swapped out.
	     X	     The process is being traced or debugged.

     tt	     An abbreviation for the pathname of the controlling terminal, if
	     any.  The abbreviation consists of the three letters following
	     /dev/tty, or, for the console, ``con''.  This is followed by a
	     ``-'' if the process can no longer reach that controlling termi-
	     nal (i.e., it has been revoked).

     wchan   The event (an address in the system) on which a process waits.
	     When printed numerically, the initial part of the address is
	     trimmed off and the result is printed in hex, for example,
	     0x80324000 prints as 324000.

     When printing using the command keyword, a process that has exited and
     has a parent that has not yet waited for the process (in other words, a
     zombie) is listed as ``<defunct>'', and a process which is blocked while
     trying to exit is listed as ``<exiting>''.	 Ps makes an educated guess as
     to the file name and arguments given when the process was created by
     examining memory or the swap area.	 The method is inherently somewhat
     unreliable and in any event a process is entitled to destroy this infor-
     mation, so the names cannot be depended on too much.
     The ucomm (accounting) keyword can, however, be depended on.
