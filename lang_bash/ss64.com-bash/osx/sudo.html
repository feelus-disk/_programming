<p>Execute a command as another user.<br>
  Allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, 
as specified in the sudoers file.</p>
<pre>Syntax
       sudo [ -H ] [-P ] [-S ] [ -b ] <i>command</i>

       sudo [ -p <i>prompt</i> ] [ -c <i>class</i>|- ]
               [ -a <i>auth_type</i> ] [ -u <i>username</i>|#<i>uid</i> ] <i>command</i>

       sudo -V | -h | -l | -L | -v | -k | -K | -s <i>command</i>

Options<i>
</i>       -a  The -a (authentication type) option causes sudo to use the speci-
	   fied authentication type when validating the user, as allowed by
	   /etc/login.conf.  The system administrator may specify a list of
	   sudo-specific authentication methods by adding an "auth-sudo" entry
	   in /etc/login.conf.	This option is only available on systems that
	   support BSD authentication where sudo has been configured with the
	   --with-bsdauth option.

       -b  The -b (background) option tells sudo to run the given command in
	   the background.  Note that if you use the -b option you cannot use
	   shell job control to manipulate the process.

       -c  The -c (class) option causes sudo to run the specified command with
	   resources limited by the specified login class.  The class argument
	   can be either a class name as defined in /etc/login.conf, or a sin-
	   gle '-' character.  Specifying a class of - indicates that the com-
	   mand should be run restricted by the default login capabilities for
	   the user the command is run as.  If the class argument specifies an
	   existing user class, the command must be run as root, or the sudo
	   command must be run from a shell that is already root.  This option
	   is only available on systems with BSD login classes where sudo has
	   been configured with the --with-logincap option.

       -h  The -h (help) option causes sudo to print a usage message and exit.

       -H  The -H (HOME) option sets the HOME environment variable to the
	   homedir of the target user (root by default) as specified in
	   passwd(5).  By default, sudo does not modify HOME.

       -k  The -k (kill) option to sudo invalidates the user's timestamp by
	   setting the time on it to the epoch.	 The next time sudo is run a
	   password will be required.  This option does not require a password
	   and was added to allow a user to revoke sudo permissions from a
	   .logout file.

       -K  The -K (sure kill) option to sudo removes the user's timestamp
	   entirely.  Likewise, this option does not require a password.

       -l  The -l (list) option will list out the allowed (and forbidden) com-
	   mands for the user on the current host.

       -L  The -L (list defaults) option will list out the parameters that may
	   be set in a Defaults line along with a short description for each.
	   This option is useful in conjunction with grep(1).

       -p  The -p (prompt) option allows you to override the default password
	   prompt and use a custom one.	 If the password prompt contains the
	   %u escape, %u will be replaced with the user's login name.  Simi-
	   larly, %h will be replaced with the local hostname.

       -P  The -P (preserve group vector) option causes sudo to preserve the
	   user's group vector unaltered.  By default, sudo will initialize
	   the group vector to the list of groups the target user is in.  The
	   real and effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the
	   target user.

       -s  The -s (shell) option runs the shell specified by the SHELL envi-
	   ronment variable if it is set or the shell as specified in
	   passwd(5).

       -S  The -S (stdin) option causes sudo to read the password from stan-
	   dard input instead of the terminal device.

       -u  The -u (user) option causes sudo to run the specified command as a
	   user other than root.  To specify a uid instead of a username, use
	   #uid.

       -v  If given the -v (validate) option, sudo will update the user's
	   timestamp, prompting for the user's password if necessary.  This
	   extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes (or whatever the
	   timeout is set to in sudoers) but does not run a command.

       -V  The -V (version) option causes sudo to print the version number and
	   exit.  If the invoking user is already root the -V option will
	   print out a list of the defaults sudo was compiled with as well as
	   the machine's local network addresses.

       --  The -- flag indicates that sudo should stop processing command line
	   arguments.  It is most useful in conjunction with the -s flag.

<b>Examples</b>
The following examples assume suitable sudoers(5) entries.

       Get a file listing of an unreadable directory:

	$ sudo ls /usr/local/protected

       Run the last command again as root:

	$ sudo !!

       List the home directory of user yazza on a machine where the
       filesystem holding ~yazza is not exported as root:

	$ sudo -u yazza ls ~yazza

       Edit the index.html file as user www:

	$ sudo -u www vi ~www/htdocs/index.html

       To shutdown a machine:

	$ sudo shutdown -r +15 "quick reboot"

       Make a usage listing of the directories in the /home partition.
       Note that this runs the commands in a sub-shell to make the cd and file
       redirection work.

	$ sudo sh -c "cd /home ; du -s * | sort -rn > USAGE"
    </pre>
<p><b>Notes<br>
  </b>By default, sudo requires that users authenticate themselves with a password 
  (by default this is the user's password, not the root password). Once a user 
  has been authenticated, a timestamp is updated and the user may then use sudo 
  without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes unless overridden in 
  sudoers). </p>
<p> sudo determines who is an authorized user by consulting the file 
  /etc/sudoers. By giving sudo the -v flag a user can update the time stamp without 
  running a command. The password prompt itself will also time out if the user's 
  password is not entered within 0 minutes (unless overridden via sudoers). If 
  a user who is not listed in the sudoers file tries to run a command via sudo, 
  mail is sent to the proper authorities, as defined at configure time or the 
  sudoers file (defaults to root). Note that the mail will not be sent if an unauthorized 
  user tries to run sudo with the -l or -v flags. This allows users to determine 
  for themselves whether or not they are allowed to use sudo. sudo can log both 
  successful and unsuccessful attempts (as well as errors) to syslog(3), a log 
  file, or both. By default sudo will log via syslog(3) but this is changeable 
  at configure time or via the sudoers file.</p>
<p>Please note that sudo will only log the command it explicitly 
  runs. If a user runs a command such as sudo su or sudo sh, subsequent commands 
  run from that shell will not be logged, nor will sudo's access control affect 
  them. The same is true for commands that offer shell escapes (including most 
  editors). Because of this, care must be taken when giving users access to commands 
  via sudo to verify that the command does not inadvertantly give the user an 
  effective root shell.</p>
<p><b>Return Values</b><br>
  Upon successful execution of a program, the return value from sudo will simply 
  be the return value of the program that was executed. Otherwise, sudo quits 
  with an exit value of 1 if there is a configuration/permission problem or if 
  sudo cannot execute the given command.</p>
<p><b>Environment<br>
  </b>sudo uses the environment variables: HOME, PATH, SHELL, USER, SUDO_PROMPT, 
  SUDO_COMMAND, SUDO_USER, SUDO_UID, SUDO_GID and SUDO_PS1.</p>
<p> <b>Files<br>
  </b>/etc/sudoers List of who can run what <br>
