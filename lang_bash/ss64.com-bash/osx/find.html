     find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f <i>pathname</i>] [<i>pathname</i> ...] <i>expression</i>

Options
     -E	     Interpret regular expressions followed by -regex and -iregex
	     options as extended (modern) regular expressions rather than
	     basic regular expressions (BRE's).	 The re_format(7) manual page
	     fully describes both formats.

     -H	     The -H option causes the file information and file type (see
	     stat(2)) returned for each symbolic link specified on the command
	     line to be those of the file referenced by the link, not the link
	     itself.  If the referenced file does not exist, the file informa-
	     tion and type will be for the link itself.	 File information of
	     all symbolic links not on the command line is that of the link
	     itself.

     -L	     The -L option causes the file information and file type (see
	     stat(2)) returned for each symbolic link to be those of the file
	     referenced by the link, not the link itself.  If the referenced
	     file does not exist, the file information and type will be for
	     the link itself.

     -P	     The -P option causes the file information and file type (see
	     stat(2)) returned for each symbolic link to be those of the link
	     itself.  This is the default.

     -X	     The -X option is a modification to permit find to be safely used
	     in conjunction with xargs(1).  If a file name contains any of the
	     delimiting characters used by xargs(1), a diagnostic message is
	     displayed on standard error, and the file is skipped.  The delim-
	     iting characters include single (` ' ') and double (` " ')
	     quotes, backslash (`\'), space, tab and newline characters.

     -d	     The -d option causes find to perform a depth-first traversal,
	     i.e., directories are visited in post-order and all entries in a
	     directory will be acted on before the directory itself.  By
	     default, find visits directories in pre-order, i.e., before their
	     contents.	Note, the default is not a breadth-first traversal.

     -f	     The -f option specifies a file hierarchy for find to traverse.
	     File hierarchies may also be specified as the operands immedi-
	     ately following the options.

     -s	     The -s option causes find to traverse the file hierarchies in
	     lexicographical order, i.e., alphabetical order within each
	     directory.	 Note: `find -s' and `find | sort' may give different
	     results.

     -x	     The -x option prevents find from descending into directories that
	     have a device number different than that of the file from which
	     the descent began.

PRIMARIES

     -amin <i>n</i>
	     True if the difference between the file last access time and the
	     time find was started, rounded up to the next full minute, is n
	     minutes.

     -anewer <i>file</i>
	     Same as -neweram.

     -atime <i>n</i>
	     True if the difference between the file last access time and the
	     time find was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour
	     period, is n 24-hour periods.

     -cmin <i>n</i>
	     True if the difference between the time of last change of file
	     status information and the time find was started, rounded up to
	     the next full minute, is n minutes.

     -cnewer <i>file</i>
	     Same as -newercm.

     -ctime <i>n</i>
	     True if the difference between the time of last change of file
	     status information and the time find was started, rounded up to
	     the next full 24-hour period, is n 24-hour periods.

     -delete
	     Delete found files and/or directories.  Always returns true.
	     This executes from the current working directory as find recurses
	     down the tree.  It will not attempt to delete a filename with a
	     `/' character in its pathname relative to `.' for security
	     reasons.  Depth-first traversal processing is implied by this
	     option.

     -depth  Always true; same as the -d option.  -depth can be useful when
	     find is used with cpio(1) to process files that are contained in
	     directories with unusual permissions.  It enures that you have
	     write permission while you are placing files in a directory, then
	     sets the directory's permissions as the last thing.

     -empty  True if the current file or directory is empty.

     -exec <i>utility</i> [<i>argument</i> ...];
	     True if the program named utility returns a zero value as its
	     exit status.  Optional arguments may be passed to the utility.
	     The expression must be terminated by a semicolon (`;').	If the
	     string `{}' appears anywhere in the utility name or the argu-
	     ments it is replaced by the pathname of the current file.
	     Utility will be executed from the directory from which find was
	     executed.	Utility and arguments are not subject to the further
	     expansion of shell patterns and constructs.

     -execdir <i>utility</i> [<i>argument</i> ...];
	     The -execdir primary is identical to the -exec primary with the
	     exception that utility will be executed from the directory that
	     holds the current file.  The filename substituted for the string
	     `{}' is not qualified.

     -flags [-|+]<i>flags</i>,<i>notflags</i>
	     The flags are specified using symbolic names (see chflags(1)).
	     Those with the "no" prefix (except "nodump") are said to be
	     notflags.	Flags in flags are checked to be set, and flags in
	     notflags are checked to be not set.  Note that this is different
	     from -perm, which only allows the user to specify mode bits that
	     are set.

	     If flags are preceded by a dash (`-'), this primary evaluates
	     to true if at least all of the bits in flags and none of the bits
	     in notflags are set in the file's flags bits.  If flags are pre-
	     ceded by a plus (`+'), this primary evaluates to true if any of
	     the bits in flags is set in the file's flags bits, or any of the
	     bits in notflags is not set in the file's flags bits.  Otherwise,
	     this primary evaluates to true if the bits in flags exactly match
	     the file's flags bits, and none of the flags bits match those of
	     notflags.

     -fstype <i>type</i>
	     True if the file is contained in a file system of type type.  The
	     sysctl(8) command can be used to find out the types of filesys-
	     tems that are available on the system:

		   sysctl vfs

	     In addition, there are two pseudo-types, `local' and
	     `rdonly'.  The former matches any file system physically
	     mounted on the system where the find is being executed and the
	     latter matches any file system which is mounted read-only.

     -group <i>gname</i>
	     True if the file belongs to the group gname.  If gname is numeric
	     and there is no such group name, then gname is treated as a group
	     ID.

     -iname <i>pattern</i>
	     Like -name, but the match is case insensitive.

     -inum <i>n</i>
	     True if the file has inode number n.

     -ipath <i>pattern</i>
	     Like -path, but the match is case insensitive.

     -iregex <i>pattern</i>
	     Like -regex, but the match is case insensitive.

     -links <i>n</i>
	     True if the file has n links.

     -ls     This primary always evaluates to true.  The following information
	     for the current file is written to standard output: its inode
	     number, size in 512-byte blocks, file permissions, number of hard
	     links, owner, group, size in bytes, last modification time, and
	     pathname.	If the file is a block or character special file, the
	     major and minor numbers will be displayed instead of the size in
	     bytes.  If the file is a symbolic link, the pathname of the
	     linked-to file will be displayed preceded by `->'.  The format
	     is identical to that produced by ls -dgils.

     -maxdepth <i>n</i>
	     True if the depth of the current file into the tree is less than
	     or equal to n.

     -mindepth <i>n</i>
	     True if the depth of the current file into the tree is greater
	     than or equal to n.

     -mmin <i>n</i>
	     True if the difference between the file last modification time
	     and the time find was started, rounded up to the next full
	     minute, is n minutes.

     -mnewer <i>file</i>
	     Same as -newer.

     -mtime <i>n</i>
	     True if the difference between the file last modification time
	     and the time find was started, rounded up to the next full
	     24-hour period, is n 24-hour periods.

     -name <i>pattern</i>
	     True if the last component of the pathname being examined matches
	     pattern.  Special shell pattern matching characters (`[',
	     `]', `*', and `?') may be used as part of pattern.  These
	     characters may be matched explicitly by escaping them with a
	     backslash (`\').

     -newer <i>file</i>
	     True if the current file has a more recent last modification time
	     than file.

     -newerXY <i>file</i>
	     True if the current file has a more recent last access time
	     (X=a), change time (X=c), or modification time (X=m) than the
	     last access time (Y=a), change time (Y=c), or modification time
	     (Y=m) of file.  In addition, if Y=t, then file is instead inter-
	     preted as a direct date specification of the form understood by
	     cvs(1).  Note that -newermm is equivalent to -newer.

     -nogroup
	     True if the file belongs to an unknown group.

     -nouser
	     True if the file belongs to an unknown user.

     -ok <i>utility</i> [argument ...];
	     The -ok primary is identical to the -exec primary with the excep-
	     tion that find requests user affirmation for the execution of the
	     utility by printing a message to the terminal and reading a
	     response.	If the response is other than `y' the command is not
	     executed and the value of the -ok expression is false.

     -okdir <i>utility</i> [argument ...];
	     The -okdir primary is identical to the -execdir primary with the
	     same exception as described for the -ok primary.

     -path <i>pattern</i>
	     True if the pathname being examined matches pattern.  Special
	     shell pattern matching characters (`[', `]', `*', and
	     `?') may be used as part of pattern.  These characters may be
	     matched explicitly by escaping them with a backslash (`\').
	     Slashes (`/') are treated as normal characters and do not have
	     to be matched explicitly.

     -perm [-|+]<i>mode</i>
	     The mode may be either symbolic (see chmod(1)) or an octal num-
	     ber.  If the mode is symbolic, a starting value of zero is
	     assumed and the mode sets or clears permissions without regard to
	     the process' file mode creation mask.  If the mode is octal, only
	     bits 07777 (S_ISUID | S_ISGID | S_ISTXT | S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG |
	     S_IRWXO) of the file's mode bits participate in the comparison.
	     If the mode is preceded by a dash (`-'), this primary evaluates
	     to true if at least all of the bits in the mode are set in the
	     file's mode bits.	If the mode is preceded by a plus (`+'),
	     this primary evaluates to true if any of the bits in the mode are
	     set in the file's mode bits.  Otherwise, this primary evaluates
	     to true if the bits in the mode exactly match the file's mode
	     bits.  Note, the first character of a symbolic mode may not be a
	     dash (`-').

     -print  This primary always evaluates to true.  It prints the pathname of
	     the current file to standard output.  If none of -exec, -ls,
	     -print0, or -ok is specified, the given expression shall be
	     effectively replaced by ( given expression ) -print.

     -print0
	     This primary always evaluates to true.  It prints the pathname of
	     the current file to standard output, followed by an ASCII NUL
	     character (character code 0).

     -prune  This primary always evaluates to true.  It causes find to not
	     descend into the current file.  Note, the -prune primary has no
	     effect if the -d option was specified.

     -regex <i>pattern</i>
	     True if the whole path of the file matches pattern using regular
	     expression.  To match a file named `./foo/xyzzy', you can use
	     the regular expression `.*/[xyz]*' or `.*/foo/.*', but not
	     `xyzzy' or `/foo/'.

     -size n[c]
	     True if the file's size, rounded up, in 512-byte blocks is n.  If
	     n is followed by a c, then the primary is true if the file's size
	     is n bytes (characters).

     -type <i>t</i>
	     True if the file is of the specified type.	 Possible file types
	     are as follows:

	     b	     block special
	     c	     character special
	     d	     directory
	     f	     regular file
	     l	     symbolic link
	     p	     FIFO
	     s	     socket

     -user <i>uname</i>
	     True if the file belongs to the user uname.  If uname is numeric
	     and there is no such user name, then uname is treated as a user
	     ID.

     All primaries which take a numeric argument allow the number to be pre-
     ceded by a plus sign (`+') or a minus sign (`-').  A preceding plus
     sign means `more than n', a preceding minus sign means `less than n'
     and neither means `exactly n'.

OPERATORS

     The primaries may be combined using the following operators.  The opera-
     tors are listed in order of decreasing precedence.

     ( expression )  This evaluates to true if the parenthesized expression
		     evaluates to true.

     ! expression
     -false expression
     -not expression
		     This is the unary NOT operator.  It evaluates to true if
		     the expression is false.

     expression -and expression
     expression expression
		     The -and operator is the logical AND operator.  As it is
		     implied by the juxtaposition of two expressions it does
		     not have to be specified.	The expression evaluates to
		     true if both expressions are true.	 The second expression
		     is not evaluated if the first expression is false.

     expression -or expression
		     The -or operator is the logical OR operator.  The expression
		     evaluates to true if either the first or the second
		     expression is true.  The second expression is not evaluated
		     if the first expression is true.

     All operands and primaries must be separate arguments to find.  Primaries
     which themselves take arguments expect each argument to be a separate
     argument to find.</pre>
<p> BUGS<br>
The special characters used by find are also special characters to many shell programs. In particular, the characters<span class="code"> *, [, ], ?, (, ), 
!, \ </span>and <span class="code">;</span> may have to be escaped from the shell. <br>
<br>
As there is no delimiter separating options and file names or file names and the expression, it is difficult to specify files named -xdev or !. These problems 
are handled by the -f option and the getopt(3) <span class="code">--</span> construct. <br>
<br>The <span class="code">-delete</span> primary does not interact well with other options that cause the filesystem tree traversal options to be changed. </P>

<p>Find files named 'secrets' in or below the directory /tmp and delete them, processing filenames in such a way that file or directory names containing single or double quotes, spaces or newlines are correctly handled.

<p>Run 'myapp' on every file in or below the current directory. Notice that the braces are enclosed in single quote marks to protect them from interpretation as shell script punctuation.

\( -size +100M -fprintf /root/big.txt '%-10s %p\n' \)</span></p>
<p>Search for files in your home directory which have been modified in the last twenty-four hours. This command works this way because the time since each file was last modified is divided by 24 hours and any remainder is discarded. That means that to match -mtime 0, a file will have to have a modification in the past which is less than 24 hours ago.</p>
<p class="code">find $HOME -mtime 0</p>
<p>Search for files which have read and write permission for their owner, and group, but which other users can read but not write to (<a href="chmod.html">664</a>). Files which meet these criteria but have other permissions bits set (for example if someone can execute the file) will not be matched.</p>
<p><span class="code">find . -perm 664</span></p>
<p>Search for files which have read and write permission for their owner and group, and which other users can read, without regard to the presence of any extra permission bits (for example the executable bit). This will match a file which has mode 0777, for example.</p>
<p><span class="code">find . -perm -664</span></p>
<p>Search for files which are writable by somebody (their owner, or their group, or anybody else).</p>
<p><span class="code">find . -perm /222</span></p>
