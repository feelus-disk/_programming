<pre>       These operators are similar to those of C and have the same precedence.
       They include

	   ||  &amp;&amp;  |  ^	 &amp;  ==	!=  =~	!~  &lt;=	&gt;=
	   &lt;  &gt; &lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;	+  -  *	 /  %  !  ~  (	)

       Here the precedence increases to the right, `==' `!='  `=~'  and	 `!~',
       `&lt;='  `&gt;='  `&lt;'	and  `&gt;',  `&lt;&lt;' and `&gt;&gt;', `+' and `-', `*' `/' and `%'
       being, in groups, at the same level.  The `==' `!=' `=~' and `!~' oper-
       ators  compare  their  arguments as strings; all others operate on num-
       bers.  The operators `=~' and `!~' are like `!=' and `=='  except  that
       the  right  hand	 side  is  a  glob-pattern against which the left hand
       operand is matched. This reduces the need for use of the <a href="switch.html">switch</a> builtin
       command in shell scripts when all that is really needed is pattern
       matching.

       Strings which begin with `0' are considered  octal  numbers.   Null  or
       missing	arguments  are considered `0'.	The results of all expressions
       are strings, which represent decimal numbers.  It is important to  note
       that  no	 two  components of an expression can appear in the same word;
       except when adjacent to components of expressions which	are  syntacti-
       cally  significant  to the parser (`&amp;' `|' `&lt;' `&gt;' `(' `)') they should
       be surrounded by spaces.

   <b>Command</b> <b>exit</b> <b>status</b>

       Commands can be executed in expressions and their exit status  returned
       by enclosing them in braces (`{}').  Remember that the braces should be
       separated from the words of the command by spaces.  Command  executions
       succeed, returning true, i.e., `1', if the command exits with status 0,
       otherwise they fail, returning false, i.e., `0'.	 If more detailed sta-
       tus information is required then the command should be executed outside
       of an expression and the <b>status</b> shell variable examined.

   <b>File</b> <b>inquiry</b> <b>operators</b>
       Some of these operators perform true/false tests on files  and  related
       objects.	 They are of the form <b>-</b><i>op</i> <i>file</i>, where <i>op</i> is one of

	   <b>r</b>   Read access
	   <b>w</b>   Write access
	   <b>x</b>   Execute access
	   <b>X</b>   Executable  in the path or shell builtin, e.g., `-X ls' and `-X
	       ls-F' are generally true, but `-X /bin/ls' is not (+)
	   <b>e</b>   Existence
	   <b>o</b>   Ownership
	   <b>z</b>   Zero size
	   <b>s</b>   Non-zero size (+)
	   <b>f</b>   Plain file
	   <b>d</b>   Directory
	   <b>l</b>   Symbolic link (+) *
	   <b>b</b>   Block special file (+)
	   <b>c</b>   Character special file (+)
	   <b>p</b>   Named pipe (fifo) (+) *
	   <b>S</b>   Socket special file (+) *
	   <b>u</b>   Set-user-ID bit is set (+)
	   <b>g</b>   Set-group-ID bit is set (+)
	   <b>k</b>   Sticky bit is set (+)
	   <b>t</b>   <i>file</i> (which must be a digit) is an open file descriptor	for  a
	       terminal device (+)
	   <b>R</b>   Has been migrated (convex only) (+)
	   <b>L</b>   Applies	subsequent  operators in a multiple-operator test to a
	       symbolic link rather than to the file to which the link	points
	       (+) *

       <i>file</i>  is command and filename expanded and then tested to see if it has
       the specified relationship to the real user.  If <i>file</i> does not exist or
       is  inaccessible	 or, for the operators indicated by `*', if the speci-
       fied file type does not exist on the current system, then all enquiries
       return false, i.e., `0'.

       These  operators may be combined for conciseness: `-<i>xy</i> <i>file</i>' is equiva-
       lent to `-<i>x</i> <i>file</i> &amp;&amp; -<i>y</i> <i>file</i>'.  (+) For example, `-fx' is true  (returns
       `1') for plain executable files, but not for directories.

       <b>L</b> may be used in a multiple-operator test to apply subsequent operators
       to a symbolic link rather than to the file to which  the	 link  points.
       For  example, `-lLo' is true for links owned by the invoking user.  <b>Lr</b>,
       <b>Lw</b> and <b>Lx</b> are always true for links and false for non-links.  <b>L</b>	has  a
       different  meaning  when it is the last operator in a multiple-operator
       test; see below.

       It is possible but not useful, and  sometimes  misleading,  to  combine
       operators  which	 expect <i>file</i> to be a file with operators which do not,
       (e.g., <b>X</b> and <b>t</b>).	 Following <b>L</b> with a non-file operator can lead to par-
       ticularly strange results.

       Other  operators	 return	 other information, i.e., not just `0' or `1'.
       (+) They have the same format as before; <i>op</i> may be one of

	   <b>A</b>	   Last file access time, as the number of seconds  since  the
		   epoch
	   <b>A:</b>	   Like <b>A</b>, but in timestamp format, e.g., `Fri May 14 16:36:10
		   1993'
	   <b>M</b>	   Last file modification time
	   <b>M:</b>	   Like <b>M</b>, but in timestamp format
	   <b>C</b>	   Last inode modification time
	   <b>C:</b>	   Like <b>C</b>, but in timestamp format
	   <b>D</b>	   Device number
	   <b>I</b>	   Inode number
	   <b>F</b>	   Composite <b>f</b>ile identifier, in the form <i>device</i>:<i>inode</i>

	   <b>L</b>	   The name of the file pointed to by a symbolic link
	   <b>N</b>	   Number of (hard) links
	   <b>P</b>	   Permissions, in octal, without leading zero
	   <b>P:</b>	   Like <b>P</b>, with leading zero
	   <b>P</b><i>mode</i>   Equivalent to `-P <i>file</i> &amp; <i>mode</i>', e.g., `-P22	<i>file</i>'  returns
		   `22'	 if  <i>file</i>  is  writable by group and other, `20' if by
		   group only, and `0' if by neither
	   <b>P</b><i>mode</i><b>:</b>  Like <b>P</b><i>mode</i><b>:</b>, with leading zero
	   <b>U</b>	   Numeric userid
	   <b>U:</b>	   Username, or the numeric userid if the username is unknown
	   <b>G</b>	   Numeric groupid
	   <b>G:</b>	   Groupname, or the  numeric  groupid	if  the	 groupname  is
		   unknown
	   <b>Z</b>	   Size, in bytes

       Only one of these operators may appear in a multiple-operator test, and
       it must be the last.  Note that <b>L</b> has a different meaning at the end of
       and  elsewhere  in  a  multiple-operator	 test.	Because `0' is a valid
       return value for many of these operators, they do not return  `0'  when
       they fail: most return `-1', and <b>F</b> returns `:'.

       If  the	shell  is  compiled  with POSIX defined (see the <b>version</b> shell
       variable), the result of a file inquiry is based on the permission bits
       of  the	file  and not on the result of the <b>access(2)</b> system call.  For
       example, if one tests a file with <b>-w</b> whose permissions would ordinarily
       allow writing but which is on a file system mounted read-only, the test
       will succeed in a POSIX shell but fail in a non-POSIX shell.

       File inquiry operators can also be evaluated with the <i>filetest</i>  builtin
       command</pre>
