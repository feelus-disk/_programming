<p>Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters. Copies the standard 
input to the standard output with substitution or deletion of selected characters.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      tr [-Ccsu] <i>string1 string2</i>
      tr [-Ccu] -d <i>string1</i>
      tr [-Ccu] -s <i>string1</i>
      tr [-Ccu] -ds <i>string1 string2</i>

Options<i>
</i>   <b>-C</b>     Complement the set of characters in <i>string1</i>, that is `-C ab'
	  includes every character except for `a' and `b'.

   <b>-c</b>     Same as <b>-C</b> but complement the set of byte values in <i>string1</i>.

   <b>-d </b>    Delete characters in <i>string1</i> from the input.

   <b>-s</b>     Squeeze multiple occurrences of the characters listed in the last
	  operand (either <i>string1</i> or <i>string2</i>) in the input into a single
	  instance of the character.	 This occurs after all deletion and
	  translation is completed.

   <b>-u</b>     Guarantee that any output is unbuffered.

     In the first synopsis form, the characters in <i>string1</i> are translated into
     the characters in <i>string2</i> where the first character in <i>string1</i> is trans-
     lated into the first character in <i>string2</i> and so on.  If <i>string1</i> is
     longer than <i>string2</i>, the last character found in <i>string2</i> is duplicated
     until <i>string1</i> is exhausted.

     In the second synopsis form, the characters in <i>string1</i> are deleted from
     the input.

     In the third synopsis form, the characters in <i>string1</i> are compressed as
     described for the <b>-s</b> option.

     In the fourth synopsis form, the characters in <i>string1</i> are deleted from
     the input, and the characters in <i>string2</i> are compressed as described for
     the <b>-s</b> option.

     The following conventions can be used in <i>string1</i> and <i>string2</i> to specify
     sets of characters:

     character	Any character not described by one of the following conven-
		tions represents itself.

     \octal	A backslash followed by 1, 2 or 3 octal digits represents a
		character with that encoded value.  To follow an octal
		sequence with a digit as a character, left zero-pad the octal
		sequence to the full 3 octal digits.

     \character
		A backslash followed by certain special characters maps to
		special values.

		\a    &lt;alert character&gt;
		\b    &lt;backspace&gt;
		\f    &lt;form-feed&gt;
		\n    &lt;newline&gt;
		\r    &lt;carriage return&gt;
		\t    &lt;tab&gt;
		\v    &lt;vertical tab&gt;

		A backslash followed by any other character maps to that char-
		acter.

     c-c	Represents the range of characters between the range end-
		points, inclusively.

     [:class:]	Represents all characters belonging to the defined character
		class.	Class names are:

		alnum	  &lt;alphanumeric characters&gt;
		alpha	  &lt;alphabetic characters&gt;
		cntrl	  &lt;control characters&gt;

		digit	  &lt;numeric characters&gt;
		graph	  &lt;graphic characters&gt;
		lower	  &lt;lower-case alphabetic characters&gt;
		print	  &lt;printable characters&gt;
		punct	  &lt;punctuation characters&gt;

		space	  &lt;space characters&gt;
		upper	  &lt;upper-case characters&gt;
		xdigit	  &lt;hexadecimal characters&gt;

		With the exception of the `upper' and `lower' classes,
		characters in the classes are in unspecified order.  In the
		`upper' and `lower' classes, characters are entered in
		ascending order.

		For specific information as to which ASCII characters are
		included in these classes, see <b>ctype(3)</b> and related manual
		pages.

     [=equiv=]	Represents all characters belonging to the same equivalence
		class as <i>equiv</i>, ordered by their encoded values.

     [#*n]	Represents <i>n</i> repeated occurrences of the character represented
		by <i>#</i>.  This expression is only valid when it occurs in
		<i>string2</i>.  If <i>n</i> is omitted or is zero, it is be interpreted as
		large enough to extend <i>string2</i> sequence to the length of
		<i>string1</i>.  If <i>n</i> has a leading zero, it is interpreted as an
		octal value, otherwise, it's interpreted as a decimal value.</pre>
<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<pre>     The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE environment variables affect
     the execution of <b>tr</b> as described in <b>environ(7)</b>.
</pre>
<p>The <span class="code">tr</span> utility has historically been extremely forgiving of syntax errors, 
  for example, the -c and -s options were ignored unless two strings were specified. 
  This implementation will not permit illegal syntax.</p>
<p>The <span class="code">tr</span> utility has historically not permitted the manipulation 
  of NUL bytes in its input and, additionally, stripped NUL's from its input stream. 
  This implementation has removed this behavior as a bug. </p>
<p>Exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p># Swap case<span class="code"><br>
$ echo &quot;Hello World&quot; | tr &quot;A-Za-z&quot; &quot;a-zA-Z&quot;<br>
hELLO wORLD</span></p>
<p># Make lower case<span class="code"><br>
$ echo &quot;Hello World&quot; | tr &quot;[:upper:]&quot; &quot;[:lower:]&quot;<br>
hello world </span></p>
<p># As a function<span class="code"><br>
$ toLower() {<br>
&nbsp;echo $1 | tr &quot;[:upper:]&quot; &quot;[:lower:]&quot; <br>
} </span></p>
<p class="code">$ toLower SomeMixEDCaseText<br>
somemixedcasetext</p>
<p># Split the path into its elements<span class="code"><br>
$ echo $PATH | tr &quot;:&quot; &quot;\n&quot; | sort</span></p>
<p>Create a list of the words in file1, one per line, where a word is taken
     to be a maximal string of letters.<span class="code"><br>
$ tr -cs "[:alpha:]" "\n" &lt; file1

</span></p>
<p>Translate the contents of file1 to upper-case.

	   <span class="code"><br>
$ tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" &lt; file1</span></p>
<p>Strip out non-printable characters from file1.

	   <span class="code"><br>
$ 
tr -cd "[:print:]" &lt; file1</span></p>
<p>Remove diacritical marks from all accented variants of the letter 'e':
<br>
<span class="code">$ tr "[=e=]" "e"</span></p>
