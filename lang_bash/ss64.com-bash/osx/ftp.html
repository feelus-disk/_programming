<p>Internet File Transfer Program. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      ftp [<i>options</i>] -u <i>url file</i> [...]

Options<i>
</i>May be specified at the command line, or to the ftp command interpreter.   

     -n	      No `auto-login' upon initial connection.

     -o <i>output</i>
	      When auto-fetching files, save the contents in <i>output</i>.  output
	      is parsed according to the <a href="ftp_options.html#naming">FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS</a>. If output 
	      is not `-' or doesn't start with `|', then only the first
	      file specified will be retrieved into output; all other files
	      will be retrieved into the basename of their remote name.

     -P <i>port</i>  Sets the port number to <i>port</i>.

     -r <i>wait</i>  Retry the connection attempt if it failed, pausing for <i>wait</i> seconds.

     -u <i>url file</i> [...]
	      Upload files on the command line to <i>url</i> where <i>url</i> is one of the
	      ftp URL types as supported by auto-fetch (with an optional target
	      filename for single file uploads), and file is one or more
	      local files to be uploaded.

     -v	      Enable verbose and progress.

     -V	      Disable verbose and progress.</pre>
<p><span class="body"> Also see the <a href="ftp_options.html"> ftp Advanced options</a> 
  page for further options.</span></p>
<p><span class="body">The client host with which ftp is to communicate may be 
  specified on the command line. If this is done, ftp will immediately attempt 
  to establish a connection to an FTP server on that host; otherwise, ftp will 
  enter its command interpreter and await instructions from the user. When ftp 
  is awaiting commands from the user the prompt `ftp>' is provided to the user.</span> 
  <br>
</p>
<pre>The following commands are recognized by ftp:

     account [<i>passwd</i>]
		 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
		 for access to resources once a login has been successfully
		 completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be
		 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

     append <i>local-file </i>[<i>remote-file</i>]
		 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If
		 remote-file is left unspecified, the local file name is used
		 in naming the remote file after being altered by any ntrans
		 or nmap setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for
		 type, format, mode, and structure.

     ascii	 Set the file transfer type to network ASCII.  This is the
		 default type.

     binary	 Set the file transfer type to support binary image transfer.

     bye	 Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit
		 ftp.  An end of file will also terminate the session and
		 exit.

     case	 Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during mget
		 commands.  When case is on (default is off), remote computer
		 file names with all letters in upper case are written in the
		 local directory with the letters mapped to lower case.

     cd remote-directory
		 Change the working directory on the remote machine to
		 remote-directory.

     cdup	 Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of
		 the current remote machine working directory.

     chmod <i>mode remote-file</i>
		 Change the permission modes of the file remote-file on the
		 remote system to mode.

     close	 Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return
		 to the command interpreter.  Any defined macros are erased.

     cr		 Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file
		 retrieval.  Records are denoted by a carriage return/linefeed
		 sequence during ascii type file transfer.  When cr is on (the
		 default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence to
		 conform with the UNIX single linefeed record delimiter.
		 Records on non-UNIX remote systems may contain single line-
		 feeds; when an ascii type transfer is made, these linefeeds
		 may be distinguished from a record delimiter only when cr is
		 off.

     delete <i>remote-file</i>
		 Delete the file <i>remote-file</i> on the remote machine.

     dir [<i>remote-path</i> [<i>local-file</i>]]
		 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote
		 machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent informa-
		 tion that the server chooses to include; for example, most
		 UNIX systems will produce output from the command `ls -l'.
		 If remote-path is left unspecified, the current working
		 directory is used.  If interactive prompting is on, ftp will
		 prompt the user to verify that the last argument is indeed
		 the target local file for receiving dir output.  If no local
		 file is specified, or if local-file is `-', the output is
		 sent to the terminal.

     fget <i>localfile</i>
		 Retrieve the files listed in localfile, which has one line
		 per filename.

     form <i>format</i>
		 Set the file transfer form to <i>format</i>.	The default format is
		 `file'.

     ftp <i>host </i>[<i>port</i>]
		 A synonym for open.

     gate [<i>host </i>[<i>port</i>]]
		 Toggle gate-ftp mode, which used to connect through the TIS
		 FWTK and Gauntlet ftp proxies.	 This will not be permitted if
		 the gate-ftp server hasn't been set (either explicitly by the
		 user, or from the FTPSERVER environment variable).  If host
		 is given, then gate-ftp mode will be enabled, and the gate-
		 ftp server will be set to host.  If port is also given, that
		 will be used as the port to connect to on the gate-ftp
		 server.

     get <i>remote-file </i>[<i>local-file</i>]
		 Retrieve the remote-file and store it on the local machine.
		 If the local file name is not specified, it is given the same
		 name it has on the remote machine, subject to alteration by
		 the current case, ntrans, and nmap settings.  The current
		 settings for type, form, mode, and structure are used while
		 transferring the file.

     glob	 Toggle filename expansion for mdelete, mget and mput.	If
		 globbing is turned off with glob, the file name arguments are
		 taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for mput is done
		 as in csh(1).	For mdelete and mget, each remote file name is
		 expanded separately on the remote machine and the lists are
		 not merged.  Expansion of a directory name is likely to be
		 different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the
		 exact result depends on the foreign operating system and ftp
		 server, and can be previewed by doing `mls remote-files -'
		 Note: mget and mput are not meant to transfer entire direc-
		 tory subtrees of files.  That can be done by transferring a
		 tar(1) archive of the subtree (in binary mode).

     hash [size]
		 Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each data block trans-
		 ferred.  The size of a data block defaults to 1024 bytes.
		 This can be changed by specifying size in bytes.  Enabling
		 hash disables progress.

     help [<i>command</i>]
		 Print an informative message about the meaning of command.
		 If no argument is given, ftp prints a list of the known com-
		 mands.

     lcd [<i>directory</i>]
		 Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no
		 directory is specified, the user's home directory is used.

     lpwd	 Print the working directory on the local machine.

     ls [<i>remote-path</i> [<i>local-file</i>]]
		 A synonym for dir.

     mdelete [<i>remote-files</i>]
		 Delete the remote-files on the remote machine.

     mdir <i>remote-files local-file</i>
		 Like dir, except multiple remote files may be specified.  If
		 interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to ver-
		 ify that the last argument is indeed the target local file
		 for receiving mdir output.

     mget <i>remote-files</i>
		 Expand the remote-files on the remote machine and do a get
		 for each file name thus produced.  See glob for details on
		 the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be
		 processed according to case, ntrans, and nmap settings.
		 Files are transferred into the local working directory, which
		 can be changed with `lcd directory'; new local directories
		 can be created with `! mkdir directory'.

     mkdir <i>directory-name</i>
		 Make a directory on the remote machine.

     mls <i>remote-files local-file</i>
		 Like ls, except multiple remote files may be specified, and
		 the local-file must be specified.  If interactive prompting
		 is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the last argu-
		 ment is indeed the target local file for receiving mls out-
		 put.

     mlsd [<i>remote-path</i>]
		 Display the contents of remote-path (which should default to
		 the current directory if not given) in a machine-parsable
		 form, using MLSD.  The format of display can be changed with
		 `remopts mlst ...'.

     mlst [<i>remote-path</i>]
		 Display the details about remote-path (which should default
		 to the current directory if not given) in a machine-parsable
		 form, using MLST.  The format of display can be changed with
		 `remopts mlst ...'.

     mode <i>mode-name</i>
		 Set the file transfer mode to <i>mode-name</i>.  The default mode is
		 `stream' mode.

     modtime <i>remote-file</i>
		 Show the last modification time of the file on the remote
		 machine.

     more <i>file</i>	 A synonym for page.

     mput <i>local-files</i>
		 Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as argu-
		 ments and do a put for each file in the resulting list.  See
		 glob for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file names
		 will then be processed according to ntrans and nmap settings.

     msend <i>local-files</i>
		 A synonym for mput.

     newer <i>remote-file </i>[<i>local-file</i>]
		 Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file
		 is more recent that the file on the current system.  If the
		 file does not exist on the current system, the remote file is
		 considered newer.  Otherwise, this command is identical to
		 get.

     nlist [<i>remote-path</i> [<i>local-file</i>]]
		 A synonym for ls.

     open <i>host</i> [<i>port</i>]
		 Establish a connection to the specified host FTP server.  An
		 optional port number may be supplied, in which case, ftp will
		 attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.	 If the
		 auto-login option is on (default), ftp will also attempt to
		 automatically log the user in to the FTP server (see below).

     page <i>file</i>	 Retrieve file and display with the program specified by the
		 set pager option.

     passive [auto]
		 Toggle passive mode (if no arguments are given).  If auto is
		 given, act as if FTPMODE is set to `auto'.  If passive mode
		 is turned on (default), ftp will send a PASV command for all
		 data connections instead of a PORT command.  The PASV command
		 requests that the remote server open a port for the data con-
		 nection and return the address of that port.  The remote
		 server listens on that port and the client connects to it.
		 When using the more traditional PORT command, the client lis-
		 tens on a port and sends that address to the remote server,
		 who connects back to it.  Passive mode is useful when using
		 ftp through a gateway router or host that controls the direc-
		 tionality of traffic.	(Note that though FTP servers are
		 required to support the PASV command by RFC 1123, some do
		 not.)

     preserve	 Toggle preservation of modification times on retrieved files.

     progress	 Toggle display of transfer progress bar.  The progress bar
		 will be disabled for a transfer that has local-file as `-' or
		 a command that starts with `|'.  Refer to FILE NAMING
		 CONVENTIONS for more information.  Enabling progress disables
		 hash.

     prompt	 Toggle interactive prompting.	Interactive prompting occurs
		 during multiple file transfers to allow the user to selec-
		 tively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off
		 (default is on), any mget or mput will transfer all files,
		 and any mdelete will delete all files.

		 When prompting is on, the following commands are available at
		 a prompt:

		       a   Answer `yes' to the current file, and automatically
			   answer `yes' to any remaining files for the current
			   command.

		       n   Answer `no', and do not transfer the file.

		       p   Answer `yes' to the current file, and turn off
			   prompt mode (as is ``prompt off'' had been given).

		       q   Terminate the current operation.

		       y   Answer `yes', and transfer the file.

		       ?   Display a help message.

		 Any other reponse will answer `yes' to the current file.

     put <i>local-file </i>[<i>remote-file</i>]
		 Store a local file on the remote machine.  If remote-file is
		 left unspecified, the local file name is used after process-
		 ing according to any ntrans or nmap settings in naming the
		 remote file.  File transfer uses the current settings for
		 type, format, mode, and structure.

     pwd	 Print the name of the current working directory on the remote
		 machine.

     quit	 A synonym for bye.

     reget <i>remote-file</i> [<i>local-file</i>]
		 reget acts like get, except that if local-file exists and is
		 smaller than remote-file, local-file is presumed to be a par-
		 tially transferred copy of remote-file and the transfer is
		 continued from the apparent point of failure.	This command
		 is useful when transferring very large files over networks
		 that are prone to dropping connections.

     rename [<i>from</i> [<i>to</i>]]
		 Rename the file from on the remote machine, to the file to.

     reset	 Clear reply queue.  This command re-synchronizes com-
		 mand/reply sequencing with the remote FTP server.  Resynchro-
		 nization may be necessary following a violation of the FTP
		 protocol by the remote server.

     rhelp [<i>command-name</i>]
		 Request help from the remote FTP server.  If a command-name
		 is specified it is supplied to the server as well.

     rmdir <i>directory-name</i>
		 Delete a directory on the remote machine.

     rstatus [<i>remote-file</i>]
		 With no arguments, show status of remote machine.  If
		 remote-file is specified, show status of remote-file on
		 remote machine.

     type [<i>type-name</i>]
		 Set the file transfer type to type-name.  If no type is spec-
		 ified, the current type is printed.  The default type is net-
		 work ASCII.

     usage <i>command</i>
		 Print the usage message for command.

     user <i>user-name</i> [<i>password </i>[<i>account</i>]]
		 Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the password
		 is not specified and the server requires it, ftp will prompt
		 the user for it (after disabling local echo).	If an account
		 field is not specified, and the FTP server requires it, the
		 user will be prompted for it.	If an account field is speci-
		 fied, an account command will be relayed to the remote server
		 after the login sequence is completed if the remote server
		 did not require it for logging in.  Unless ftp is invoked
		 with `auto-login' disabled, this process is done automati-
		 cally on initial connection to the FTP server.

     verbose	 Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose mode, all responses from the
		 FTP server are displayed to the user.	In addition, if ver-
		 bose is on, when a file transfer completes, statistics
		 regarding the efficiency of the transfer are reported.	 By
		 default, verbose is on.

     xferbuf size
		 Set the size of the socket send and receive buffers to size.

     ? [command]
		 A synonym for help.

Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be quoted with quote " marks.

Commands which toggle settings can take an explicit on or off argument to
force the setting appropriately.

     Commands which take a byte count as an argument (e.g., hash, rate, and
     xferbuf) support an optional suffix on the argument which changes the
     interpretation of the argument.  Supported suffixes are:
	   b	Causes no modification. (Optional)
	   k	Kilo; multiply the argument by 1024
	   m	Mega; multiply the argument by 1048576
	   g	Giga; multiply the argument by 1073741824

     If ftp receives a SIGINFO (see the ``status'' argument of stty(1)) or
     SIGQUIT signal whilst a transfer is in progress, the current transfer
     rate statistics will be written to the standard error output, in the same
     format as the standard completion message.

AUTO-FETCHING FILES</pre>
<p><span class="body"> In addition to standard commands, this version of ftp supports 
  an auto-fetch feature. To enable auto-fetch, simply pass the list of host-names/files 
  on the command line.</span> </p>
<pre>The following formats are valid syntax for an auto-fetch element:

     [user@]host:[path][/]
	   `Classic' FTP format.

	   If path contains a glob character and globbing is enabled, (see
	   glob), then the equivalent of `mget path' is performed.

	   If the directory component of path contains no globbing characters,
	   it is stored locally with the name basename (see basename(1)) of
	   path, in the current directory.  Otherwise, the full remote name is
	   used as the local name, relative to the local root directory.

     ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path[/][;type=X]
	   An FTP URL, retrieved using the FTP protocol if set ftp_proxy isn't
	   defined.  Otherwise, transfer the URL using HTTP via the proxy
	   defined in set ftp_proxy.  If set ftp_proxy isn't defined and user
	   is given, login as user.  In this case, use password if supplied,
	   otherwise prompt the user for one.

	   In order to be compliant with RFC 1738, ftp strips the leading `/'
	   from path, resulting in a transfer relative from the default login
	   directory of the user.  If the / directory is required, use a lead-
	   ing path of `%2F'.	 If a user's home directory is required (and
	   the remote server supports the syntax), use a leading path of
	   `%7Euser/'.  For example, to retrieve /etc/motd from `localhost'
	   as the user `myname' with the password `mypass', use
	   `ftp://myname:mypass@localhost/%2fetc/motd'

	   If a suffix of `;type=A' or `;type=I' is supplied, then the trans-
	   fer type will take place as ascii or binary (respectively).	The
	   default transfer type is binary.

     http://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path
	   An HTTP URL, retrieved using the HTTP protocol.  If set http_proxy
	   is defined, it is used as a URL to an HTTP proxy server.  If HTTP
	   authorisation is required to retrieve path, and `user' (and option-
	   ally `password') is in the URL, use them for the first attempt to
	   authenticate.

     file:///path
	   A local URL, copied from /path.

     Unless noted otherwise above, and -o output is not given, the file is
     stored in the current directory as the basename(1) of path.

     If a classic format or an FTP URL format has a trailing `/' or an empty
     path component, then ftp will connect to the site and cd to the directory
     given as the path, and leave the user in interactive mode ready for fur-
     ther input.  This will not work if set ftp_proxy is being used.

     Direct HTTP transfers use HTTP 1.1.  Proxied FTP and HTTP transfers use
     HTTP 1.0.

     If -R is given, all auto-fetches that don't go via the FTP or HTTP prox-
     ies will be restarted.  For FTP, this is implemented by using reget
     instead of get.  For HTTP, this is implemented by using the `Range:
     bytes=' HTTP/1.1 directive.

     If WWW or proxy WWW authentication is required, you will be prompted to
     enter a username and password to authenticate with.

     When specifying IPv6 numeric addresses in a URL, you need to surround the
     address in square brackets.  E.g.: `ftp://[::1]:21/'.  This is because
     colons are used in IPv6 numeric address as well as being the separator
     for the port number.

ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER

     To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-C).
     Sending transfers will be immediately halted.

FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS

     The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file
     transfer.	The type may be one of `ascii', `image' (binary),
     `ebcdic', and `local byte size' (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly).
     ftp supports the ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte
     size 8 for tenex mode transfers.

     ftp supports only the default values for the remaining file transfer
     parameters: mode, form, and struct.</pre>
