<pre>Syntax
      tmutil <i>verb</i> [<i>options</i>]

BACKUP STRUCTURE
     Throughout this manual, specific language is used to describe particular "realms" associated with Time
     Machine backups. It is important to understand this terminology to make effective use of tmutil and its
     manual.

     backup source
             A volume currently being backed up by Time Machine.

     backup disk
             The HFS+ volume that contains Time Machine backups.

     backup destination
             In the case of a local destination, a synonym for backup disk. For network destinations, this
             is the AFP share on which the backup disk image resides.

     backup disk image (or backup image)
             A sparsebundle that, when mounted, is the backing store for a volume that is a backup disk.

     backup store
             The top-level "Backups.backupdb" directory at the root of a backup disk.

     machine directory
             A directory inside a backup store that contains all the backups for a particular computer. For
             local destinations, a backup store can contain multiple machine directories, all for separate
             computers.

     snapshot
             A directory inside a machine directory that represents a single initial or incremental backup
             of one computer. The word "snapshot", in most contexts, is a generic term and is not to be confused
             with a "local Time Machine snapshot", which is simply a snapshot stored locally on the
             computer.

     snapshot volume
             A directory inside a snapshot that represents a single initial or incremental backup of one
             backup source. E.g.,

             /Volumes/Chronoton/Backups.backupdb/thermopylae/2011-07-03-123456/Mac HD

VERBS
     Each verb is listed with its description and individual arguments.

     help [<i>verb</i>]
             Print extended usage for a given verb. If no verb is provided, print a list of verbs and usage
             summaries.

     enable
             Turn on automatic backups. Requires root privileges.

     disable
             Turn off automatic backups. Requires root privileges.

     enablelocal
             Turn on local Time Machine snapshots. Requires root privileges.

     disablelocal
             Turn off local Time Machine snapshots and trigger automatic cleanup of accumulated local snapshot
             data. Requires root privileges.

     snapshot
             Create new local Time Machine snapshot.

     startbackup [-b | --block] [-r | --rotation] [-d | --destination <i>dest_id</i>]
             Perform a standard backup. This is equivalent to choosing "Back Up Now" from the Time Machine
             menu extra.

             Options:
                 --block          Wait (block) until the backup is finished before exiting.
                 --rotation       Allow automatic destination rotation during the backup.
                 --destination    Perform the backup to the destination corresponding to the specified ID.

     stopbackup
             Cancel a backup currently in progress.

     delete <i>snapshot_path</i> ...
             Delete one or more snapshots in an arbitrary machine directory. This verb can delete snapshots
             from backups that were not made by, or are not claimed by, the current machine. Requires root
             privileges.

     restore [-v] <i>src</i> ... <i>dst</i>
             Restore the item <i>src</i>, which is inside a snapshot, to the location <i>dst</i>. The <i>dst</i> argument mimics
             the destination path semantics of the <a href="cp.html">cp</a> tool. You may provide multiple source paths to
             restore. The last path argument must be a destination.

             When using the restore verb, tmutil behaves largely like Finder. Custom Time Machine metadata
             (extended security and other) will be removed from the restored data, and other metadata will
             be preserved.

             Root privileges are not strictly required to perform restores, but tmutil does no permissions
             preflighting to determine your ability to restore src or its descendants. Therefore, depending
             on what you're restoring, you may need root privileges to perform the restore, and you should
             know this ahead of time. This is the same behavior you would encounter with other copy tools
             such as cp or ditto. When restoring with tmutil as root, ownership of the restored items will
             match the state of the items in the backup.

     compare [-@esmugtdEX] [-D <i>depth</i>] [-I <i>name</i>] [<i>snapshot_path</i> | <i>path1 path2</i>]
             Perform a backup diff.

             If no arguments are provided, tmutil will compare the computer to the latest snapshot. If a
             snapshot path is provided as the sole argument, tmutil will compare the computer to the specified
             snapshot. If two path arguments are provided, tmutil will compare those two items to each
             other.  tmutil will attempt to inform you when you have asked it to do something that doesn't
             make sense or isn't supported.

             The compare verb allows you to specify what properties to compare. If you specify no property
             options, it is assumed that you want to compare a basic set of metadata. This default property
             set is equivalent to the -smugt option set. Specifying any property option overrides the
             default set.

             Options:
                 -a    Compare all supported metadata.
                 -@    Compare extended attributes.
                 -e    Compare ACLs.
                 -s    Compare sizes.
                 -m    Compare file modes.
                 -u    Compare UIDs.
                 -g    Compare GIDs.
                 -t    Compare modification times.
                 -d    Compare file data forks.
                 -D    Limit traversal depth to depth levels from the beginning of iteration.
                 -E    Don't take exclusions into account when comparing items inside volumes.
                 -I    Ignore paths with a path component equal to name during iteration. This may be specified
                       multiple times.
                 -X    Print output in XML property list format.

     setdestination [-ap] <i>arg</i>
             Configure a local HFS+ volume or AFP share as a backup destination. Requires root privileges.

             When the -a option is provided, arg will be added to the list of destinations. Time Machine
             will automatically choose a backup destination from the list when performing backups. When the
             -a option is not provided, the current list of destinations will be replaced by <i>arg</i>.

             If you wish to set an HFS+ volume as the backup destination, <i>arg</i> should be the mount point of
             the volume in question. When setting an AFP destination <i>arg</i> takes the form:

             afp://user[:pass]@host/share

             In the AFP case, the password component of the URL is optional; you may instead specify the -p
             option to enter the password at a non-echoing interactive prompt. This is of particular interest
             to the security-conscious, as all arguments provided to a program are visible by all users
             on the system via the <a href="ps.html">ps</a> tool.

     destinationinfo [-X]
             Print information about destinations currently configured for use with Time Machine. For each
             backup destination, the following information may be displayed:

                 Name          The volume label as shown in Finder.
                 Kind          Whether the destination is locally attached storage or a network device.
                 URL           In the case of a network destination, the URL used for Time Machine configuration.
                 Mount Point   If the volume is currently mounted, the path in the file system at which it
                               was mounted.
                 ID            The unique identifier for the destination.

             When more than one destination is configured, the most recent backup destination will be marked
             with the > indicator.

             When the -X option is provided, output will be printed in XML property list format.

     removedestination <i>identifier</i>
             Remove the destination with the specified unique identifier from the Time Machine configuration.
             Requires root privileges.

             To obtain the unique identifier for a destination, see destinationinfo.

     addexclusion [-p] <i>item</i> ...
             Configure an exclusion that tells Time Machine not to back up a file, directory, or volume during
             future backups.

             There are two kinds of user-configurable exclusions in Time Machine. The first, which is the
             default behavior for the addexclusion verb, is a location-independent ("sticky") exclusion that
             follows a file or directory. When the file or directory is moved, the exclusion goes with the
             item to the new location. Additionally, when the item is copied, the copy retains the exclusion.

             The second kind of exclusion is what is known as a fixed-path exclusion. In this scenario, you
             tell Time Machine that you want a specific path to be excluded, agnostic of the item at that
             path. If there is no file or directory at the specified path, the exclusion has no effect; if
             the item previously at the path has been moved or renamed, the item is not excluded, because it
             does not currently reside at the excluded path. As a consequence of these semantics, moving a
             file or directory to the path will cause the item to be excluded--fixed-path exclusions are not
             automatically cleaned up when items are moved or deleted and will take effect again once an
             item exists at an excluded path.

             The -p option sets a fixed-path exclusion as described above. Requires root privileges.

             Volume exclusions can be set with the addexclusion verb. The -p option is ignored for volumes;
             exclusions set on volumes track the volume regardless of volume name or mount path changes.
             Erasing the volume will cause it to be included in future backups. (See associatedisk.)
             Requires root privileges.

     removeexclusion [-p] <i>item</i> ...
             Configure Time Machine to back up a file, directory, or volume during future backups. This verb
             follows the same usage, exclusion style, and privilege semantics as addexclusion.

     isexcluded [-X] <i>item</i> ...
             Determine if a file, directory, or volume are excluded from Time Machine backups.

             When the -X option is provided, output will be printed in XML property list format.

             # example output for an excluded item
             thermopylae:~ thoth$ tmutil isexcluded /Users/admin/Desktop/foo.txt
             [Excluded]      /Users/admin/Desktop/foo.txt

             # example output for an item that is not excluded
             thermopylae:~ thoth$ tmutil isexcluded /Users/admin/Desktop/bar.txt
             [Included]      /Users/admin/Desktop/bar.txt

     inheritbackup {<i>machine_directory</i> | <i>sparsebundle</i>}
             Claim a machine directory or sparsebundle for use by the current machine. Requires root privileges.

             Machine directories and sparsebundles are owned by one computer at a time, and are tracked by
             unique identifiers rather than computer name, host name, or ethernet address. The inheritbackup
             verb reassigns the identity of the specified item, reconfiguring it so the current host recognizes
             it during backups. When inheriting a sparsebundle, the machine directory within will also
             be claimed.

             Inheriting is typically only one step in the process of configuring a backup for use by a
             machine. You may also need to use setdestination, associatedisk, or both, depending on the situation.

             One machine can own multiple machine directories and sparsebundles, but it is ill-advised for
             them to reside in the same place. In such a situation, which will be chosen during a backup is
             undefined. As a result, inheritbackup will attempt to detect possible identity collisions
             before making changes.

     associatedisk [-a] <i>mount_point snapshot_volume</i>
             Bind a snapshot volume directory to the specified local disk, thereby reconfiguring the backup
             history. Requires root privileges.

             In Mac OS X, HFS+ volumes have a persistent UUID that is assigned when the file system is created.
             Time Machine uses this identifier to make an association between a source volume and a
             snapshot volume. Erasing the source volume creates a new file system on the disk, and the previous
              UUID is not retained. The new UUID causes the source volume -> snapshot volume assocation
             to be broken. If one were just erasing the volume and starting over, it would likely be of no
             real consequence, and the new UUID would not be a concern; when erasing a volume in order to
             clone another volume to it, recreating the association may be desired.

             A concrete example of when and how you would use associatedisk:

             After having problems with a volume, you decide to erase it and manually restore its contents
             from a Time Machine backup or copy of another nature. (I.e., not via the Mac OS X installer's
             System Restore feature or Migration Assistant.) On your next incremental backup, the data will
             be copied anew, as though none of it had been backed up before. Technically, it is true that
             the data has not been backed up, given the new UUID. However, this is probably not what you
             want Time Machine to do. You would then use associatedisk to reconfigure the backup so it
             appears that this volume has been backed up previously:

             Mac64:~ thoth$ sudo tmutil associatedisk [-a] "/Volumes/MyNewStuffDisk"  "/Volumes/Chronoton/Backups.backupdb/Mac64/Latest/MyStuff"

             The result of the above command would associate the snapshot volume MyStuff in the specified
             snapshot with the source volume MyNewStuffDisk. The snapshot volume would also be renamed to
             match. The -a option tells associatedisk to find all snapshot volumes in the same machine
             directory that match the identity of MyStuff, and then perform the association on all of them.

     latestbackup
             Print the path to the most recent snapshot for this computer.

     listbackups
             Print paths for all of this computer's completed snapshots.

     machinedirectory
             Print the path to the current machine directory for this computer.

     calculatedrift <i>machine_directory</i>
             Analyze the snapshots in a machine directory and determine the amount of change between each.
             Averages are printed after all snapshots have been analyzed. This may require root privileges,
             depending on the contents of the machine directory.

     uniquesize <i>path</i> ...
             Analyze the specified <i>path</i> and determine its unique size. The figure reported by uniquesize
             represents things that only exist in the specified path; things that are hard-linked in other
             places are not tallied.
