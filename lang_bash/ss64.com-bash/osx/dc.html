<h2>Printing Commands</h2>
<pre>   p     Print the value on the top of the stack, without altering the
	      stack. A newline is printed after the value.

   n     Print the value on the top of the stack, popping it off, and
	      do not print a newline after.

   P     Pop off the value on top of the stack. If it a string, it
	      is simply printed without a trailing newline.  Otherwise it is a
	      number, and the integer portion of its absolute value is printed
	      out as  a	 "base	(UCHAR_MAX+1)"	byte  stream.

   f     Print the entire contents of the stack without altering anything.
         This is a good command to use if you are lost or want to
         figure out what the effect of some command has been.
</pre>
<p>dc works with postfix notation; rather like many HP Calculators.
Basic arithmetic uses the standard + - / * symbols 
but entered <b>after</b> the digits</p>
<pre>  so entering:<br>
   100<br>   0.5<br>   *<br>   p
   will return 50
</pre>
<h2>Arithmetic</h2>
<pre>
   +     Pop two values off the stack, add them, and push the result.
	      The precision of the result is determined only by the values of
	      the arguments, and is enough to be exact.

   -     Pop two values, subtract the first one popped from the second
	      one popped, and push the result.

   *     Pop two values,  multiply them, and push the result. The
	      number of fraction digits in the result depends on the  current
	      precision	value and the number of fraction digits in the two
	      arguments.

   /     Pop two values, divide the second one popped from the	first
	      one popped, and push the result.  The number of fraction digits
         is specified by the precision value.

   %     Pop two values, compute the remainder of the division that the /
         command would do, and push that.  The value computed is the
	      same as that computed by the sequence Sd dld/ Ld*- .

   ~     Pop two values, divide the second one popped from the	first
         one  popped. The quotient is pushed first, and the remainder is
	      pushed next. The number of fraction digits used in the division
	      is specified by the precision value.  (The sequence SdSn lnld/
	      LnLd% could also accomplish this function, with slightly differ-
	      ent error checking.)

   ^     Pop two values and exponentiate, using the first value popped
	      as the exponent and the second popped as the base.  The fraction
	      part  of the exponent is ignored.	 The precision value specifies
	      the number of fraction digits in the result.

   |     Pop three values and compute a modular exponentiation. The
	      first value popped is used as the reduction modulus; this value
	      must be a non-zero number, and should be an integer.  The second
	      popped  is  used as the exponent; this value must be a non-nega-
	      tive number, and any fractional part of this  exponent  will  be
	      ignored.	The third value popped is the base which gets exponen-
	      tiated, which should be an integer.  For small integers this  is
	      like  the sequence Sm^Lm%, but, unlike ^, this command will work
	      with arbritrarily large exponents.

   v     Pop one value, computes its square root, and pushes that. The
	      precision	value specifies the number of fraction digits in the
	      result.
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Most arithmetic operations are affected	by  the	 `precision  value',
which  you  can set with the k command.	The default precision value is
zero, which means that all arithmetic except for addition and  subtraction produces integer results.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Stack Control</h2>
<pre>
   c     Clear the stack, rendering it empty.

   d     Duplicate  the  value  on the top of the stack, pushing another
	      copy of it.  Thus, `4d*p' computes 4 squared and prints it.

   r     Reverse the order of (swaps) the top two values on the stack.
</pre>
<h2>Registers</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Dc provides at least 256 memory registers, each named by a single character.	You  can store a number or a string in a register and retrieve<br>
it later.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>
   sr   Pop the value off the top of the stack and store it into register r.

   lr   Copy the value in register r and push it onto the stack.
        This does not alter the contents of r.

        Each register also contains its own stack. The current register value
        is the top of the register's stack.

   Sr   Pop  the	value off the top of the (main) stack and push it onto
	     the stack of register r.	The previous  value  of	 the  register
	     becomes inaccessible.

   Lr   Pop the value off the top of register r's stack and push it onto
	     the main stack.  The previous value in register  r's  stack,  if
	     any, is now accessible via the lr command.
</pre>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Dc has three parameters that control its operation: the precision, the
input radix, and the output radix.  The precision specifies the	number       
of fraction digits to keep in the result of most arithmetic operations.       
The input radix controls the interpretation of numbers  typed  in;  all       
numbers typed in use this radix.	 The output radix is used for printing       
numbers.<br>
<br>       
The input and output radices are separate parameters; you can make them       
unequal,	 which	can  be	 useful or confusing.  The input radix must be       
between 2 and 16 inclusive.  The output radix must be at least 2.   The       
precision must be zero or greater.  The precision is always measured in       
decimal digits, regardless of the current input or output radix.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>
       i      Pops the value off the top of the stack and uses it to  set  the
	      input radix.

       o      Pops  the	 value off the top of the stack and uses it to set the
	      output radix.

       k      Pops the value off the top of the stack and uses it to  set  the
	      precision.

       I      Pushes the current input radix on the stack.

       O      Pushes the current output radix on the stack.

       K      Pushes the current precision on the stack.
</pre>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Dc  can	operate on strings as well as on numbers.  The only things you       
can do with strings are print them and execute them  as	macros	(which       
means  that  the	 contents of the string are processed as dc commands).       
All registers and the stack can	hold  strings,	and  dc	 always	 knows       
whether	any  given object is a string or a number.  Some commands such       
as arithmetic operations demand numbers as arguments and	 print	errors       
if  given  strings.   Other  commands  can  accept either a number or a       
string; for example, the p command can accept  either  and  prints  the       
object according to its type.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>   [characters]
	      Makes a string containing characters (contained between balanced
	      [ and ] characters), and pushes it on the stack.	 For  example,
	      [foo]P prints the characters foo (with no newline).

   a      The  top-of-stack	 is popped.  If it was a number, then the low-
	      order byte of this number is converted into a string and	pushed
	      onto  the	 stack.	  Otherwise the top-of-stack was a string, and
	      the first character of that string is pushed back.

   x      Pops a value off the stack and executes it as a macro.  Normally
	      it  should  be  a string; if it is a number, it is simply pushed
	      back onto the stack.  For example, [1p]x executes the  macro  1p
	      which pushes 1 on the stack and prints 1 on a separate line.
</pre>
<p>Macros are  most  often stored in registers; <span class="code">[1p]sa</span> stores a macro to
print 1 into register a, and lax invokes this macro.</p>
<pre>
   &gt;r     Pops two values off the stack and compares  them	assuming  they
	      are  numbers, executing the contents of register r as a macro if
	      the original top-of-stack is greater.  Thus, 1 2>a  will	invoke
	      register a's contents and 2 1>a will not.

   !&gt;r    Similar  but  invokes  the macro if the original top-of-stack is
	      not greater than (less than or equal to) what was the second-to-
	      top.

   &lt;r    similar but invokes the macro if original top-of-stack is less.

  !&lt;r    similar  but invokes the macro if original top-of-stack is not less
         than (greater or equal to) what  was second-to-top.

   =r    similar but invokes the macro if two numbers popped are equal.

   !=r   similar but invokes the macro if two numbers popped are not equal.

   ?     Reads a line	from terminal and executes it.	 this command
	      allows to request input user.

   q     exit from a macro and also from the macro which invoked it.  If called from the
         top level, or from a macro which was called directly from the top level,  the  q
         command will cause dc to exit.

   Q     Pop a value off the stack and uses it as a count of levels of macro execution
         to be exited.  Thus, 3Q exits three levels.
         The Q command will never  cause  dc to exit.
</pre>
<h2>Status Inquiry</h2>
<pre>   Z     Pop a value off the stack, calculates the number of digits it has (or number of
         characters, if it is a string) and pushes that number.

   X     Pop a value off the stack, calculates the number of fraction digits it has, and
         pushes that number. For a string, the value pushed is 0.

   z     Push the current stack depth: the number of objects on the stack before the
         execution of the z command.
</pre>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<pre>
   !     Will run the rest of the line as a system command.  Note that parsing of the !&lt;,
           !=,  and  !&gt;  commands take precedence, so if you want to run a command starting
         with &lt;, =, or &gt; you will need to add a space after the !.

   #     Will interpret the rest of the line as a comment.

   :r    Will pop the top two values off of the stack.  The  old  second-
	      to-top  value  will be stored in the array r, indexed by the old
	      top-of-stack value.

   ;r    Pop the top-of-stack and uses it as an index into the array  r.
	      The selected value is then pushed onto the stack.
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that each stacked instance of a register has its own array associated with it.  Thus <span class="code">1 0:a 0Sa 2 0:a La 0;ap</span> will print 1, because the 2
was stored in an instance of <span class="code">0:a</span> that was later popped.</p>
